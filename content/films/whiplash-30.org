"What does it cost to be great?" doesn't give you an easy answer. We all want to believe that passion and hard work are enough, but Fletcher throws a wrench into that whole comforting narrative. He's the guy who actually cares whether anyone achieves something extraordinary. Everyone else in Andrew's life is so supportive and nice, but there's this nagging feeling that their version of success is just showing up and being pleasant. 

What gets me every time is that final performance. Andrew's bleeding, exhausted, humiliated, and he chooses to go back out there. Not for Fletcher, really, but for himself and for something bigger than both of them. That moment when they lock eyes and Andrew just takes off on that drum solo, it's like watching someone decide their entire life philosophy in real time. It doesn't tell you if he made the right choice. It just shows you someone becoming exactly what they wanted to be, consequences and all.
