There's this beautiful sadness running through Cinema Paradiso. It's about loving movies, yes, but it's really about loving anything so much that leaving it behind breaks something in you. Toto grows up in that projection booth, falling in love with cinema and with Alfredo and with that girl he never quite gets over. And then he leaves and becomes successful and never goes back until it's too late. That final scene where he watches all those censored kisses spliced together, it just destroys me every time. All those moments Alfredo saved for him, waiting decades to remind him that beauty exists and it's worth preserving, even the parts people tried to hide.
