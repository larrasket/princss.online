Roger is kind of a monster. He's this advertising copywriter who weaponizes language, who sees every interaction as a game he needs to win. And then his teenage nephew shows up wanting to learn how to talk to women, and you watch Roger try to teach him everything wrong. But here's the thing: the film knows Roger is broken. You see glimpses of who he was before he built this whole persona, and it's almost sad how much effort he puts into being cruel. Campbell Scott plays him with such precise, coiled energy that you can't look away even when he's being awful. It's a film about masculinity that actually has something to say about it.
