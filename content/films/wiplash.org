#+genre: Fantasy, Horror
#+director: Robert Eggers

You know what--Eggers gives a pretty decent attempt at remaking what is considered a "classic" by some, but mostly falls short (both narratively and visually) at making anything really strike fear into the heart of those--mainly me--watching..

First, some captivating individual framings; Eggers does have some knack or talent for directing, but man does this whole film feel kind of lacking at least from an aesthetic viewpoint. I genuinely think Tim Burton would have benefited more from remaking this than Eggers, but whatever.

Rating: Nosfera-poo! Two thumbs down, yet one thumbs up for trying.
