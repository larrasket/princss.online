Chance is just a gardener. That's literally all he knows. And yet somehow everyone around him interprets his simple observations about gardens and seasons as profound wisdom. The thing is, they're not entirely wrong? When he says "there will be growth in the spring," it's technically true about economics too. The film is this perfect satire about how much we project onto people we want to believe in. Chance doesn't change at all throughout the movie. He's the same guy from beginning to end. It's everyone else who transforms him into what they need him to be. And that final shot of him walking on water... I still don't know if it's a joke or something deeper, and I think that's the point.
