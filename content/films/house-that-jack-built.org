Von Trier structures the whole thing like Dante's Inferno, with Jack descending through circles of his own making. Verge is literally Virgil, guiding us through this hell while Jack tries to justify his murders as art. And the sick thing is that Jack makes compelling arguments. He talks about cathedrals and decay and the icons of great killers, and you find yourself nodding before you remember what he did to earn this philosophical platform. The film is unwatchable in places, deliberately so. Von Trier is testing you, asking how much you'll tolerate for the sake of art.

That final sequence where Jack literally descends into hell, walking through illustrations of the Inferno, it's almost too on the nose. But there's something honest about it. Jack wanted to build something lasting, something beautiful out of destruction. And in the end he gets exactly what he deserves: an eternity of falling, reaching for a light he'll never touch. Some houses shouldn't be built.
