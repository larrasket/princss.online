#+director: Kim Ki-duk

Almost no dialogue in this entire film and somehow it says more than most movies that never shut up. Tae-suk breaks into empty houses not to steal but to live there temporarily, to exist in other people's spaces without taking anything. And then he finds Sun-hwa and they just... understand each other without words. Kim Ki-duk makes loneliness visible and then shows you how two lonely people can create their own silent world together. That ending where he becomes like a ghost, always behind her husband, always invisible but always present. It shouldn't be romantic but it is. Sometimes the deepest connections are the ones that don't need to be explained. Although it's sad that it's about interrupting a marriage relationship.
