    You know what--Eggers gives a pretty decent attempt at remaking what is considered a "classic" by some, but mostly falls short (both narratively and visually) at making anything really strike fear into the heart of those--mainly me--watching..
    <p>First, some captivating individual framings; Eggers does have some knack or talent for directing, but man does this whole film feel kind of lacking at least from an aesthetic viewpoint. I genuinely think Tim Burton would have benefited more from remaking this than Eggers, but whatever.</p>
    <p>Rating: Nosfera-poo! Two thumbs down, yet one thumbs up for trying.</p>

    A film completely about its undoing and rebirth. Have never labeled myself a fan of Evangelion, nor has it impacted me like it has for many others, but <i>Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon a Time</i> is by far my favorite Thing from anything Evangelion.
    <p>Rating: Cel animation is still better than CGI though</p>

    Something about this one in particular hit me more than the two previous Rebuild films. Personally love how fleshed out Kaworu and Shinji's relationship is.
    <p>Rating: More like Evangelion: Pee.0!</p>
