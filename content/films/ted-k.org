Say what you will about Kaczynski's methods, but the man understood something about modern life that most people refuse to admit. He saw where technology was heading decades before the rest of us started worrying about algorithms and attention spans. The film doesn't try to make him sympathetic exactly, but it does let you into his world. That cabin in Montana, the silence of the woods, the journals filled with ideas that are uncomfortable precisely because they're not entirely wrong. Industrial society really has created a kind of cage that most people don't even notice they're in. Ted just noticed earlier than everyone else and couldn't figure out how to make anyone listen without making them afraid. The tragedy is that his ideas got lost because of how he delivered them.
