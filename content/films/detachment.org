#+genre: Drama
#+director: Tony Kaye

There's this scene where he's teaching and he just starts drawing on the chalkboard, and the students actually pay attention because for once someone is being real with them. Kaye shoots it like a documentary sometimes, all handheld and raw, which makes the more poetic moments hit harder. The system is broken, the kids are broken, the teachers are broken. But there are these tiny moments of genuine connection that almost make it bearable. Almost.
