Everyone in this family was a genius as a child and then they all grew up and got stuck. That's the tragedy and the comedy of it. Royal is a terrible father who abandoned them and now wants back in, and you shouldn't root for him but somehow you do. Anderson fills every frame with so much detail, so much careful symmetry, that you'd think it would feel cold. But it doesn't. There's real pain under all those perfectly composed shots. Margot in the bathtub with Luke Wilson, Richie taking off his wristbands. These characters are broken in very specific ways and the film just lets them be broken while still loving them. That's what family is, I guess.
