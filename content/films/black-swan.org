Black Swan is not about ballet. I mean, yes, there's a lot of ballet, and it's gorgeous and terrifying at the same time. But what it's actually about is that weird thing where you want something so badly that you start to lose yourself in the process. Nina doesn't just want to be perfect, she needs it like oxygen. And the film makes you understand that kind of obsession without judging it too harshly.

The transformation stuff is so unsettling because it feels true somehow. When you push yourself past every limit, when you refuse to let go of control, something has to give. The line between dedication and destruction gets so thin you can't see it anymore. And that final scene where she finally lets go, finally becomes the Black Swan, it's both liberation and annihilation at once. She found perfection, sure, but the cost was everything. Still, you watch her face in that moment and you think... maybe she'd do it all over again.
