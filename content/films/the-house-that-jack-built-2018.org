Cinematic inferno. Each murder is a layer of a personal hell, just like the structure of Dante’s Inferno where sins are catalogued and punished according to their nature. Jack’s meticulous attention to detail mirrors the human tendency to rationalize wrongdoing, and like Dante’s journey, the film becomes both a meditation on punishment and an exploration.
