Ideas are bulletproof. That line sticks with you because the whole film is about exactly that. V wears a mask not because he's hiding but because he wants to become something larger than one person. The revolution he starts isn't really about bombs or violence, it's about waking people up to what they already know but are too scared to admit. Everyone in that society traded their freedom for safety and then pretended it was fine. The most powerful scene isn't the explosions, it's when thousands of ordinary people put on the mask and march. V could die because V was never just a man. Once enough people believe in an idea, it doesn't need a body anymore.

What I keep thinking about is how the film shows that tyranny doesn't arrive all at once. It creeps in while everyone's looking the other way, making small compromises that seem reasonable at the time. And by the time you notice, it's almost too late. The revolution has to start somewhere, with someone willing to be the first to say no. V just made it contagious.
