The hunt is really a great painful watch. I wish more people would watch it.

it refuses the comfort of moral shortcuts: it shows how a community’s need for innocence can turn suspicion into certainty, and certainty into violence, without the slow discipline of proof. Suffering alone does not equal truth, and treating “the victim” as an unquestionable oracle replaces justice with ritual. This is why the role of lawyers is not a cynical technicality but a moral necessity: to defend anyone, even those accused of the most repellent crimes, is not to excuse the act but to protect the integrity of judgment itself. A system that refuses defense has already decided, and a system that has already decided no longer seeks truth—it seeks purification.
