Bad day. Stuck in traffic, the air conditioning is broken, and something inside him just snaps. What follows is this weird odyssey through Los Angeles where a guy in a short-sleeve shirt gradually escalates from annoyance to violence. Every petty frustration he encounters is real. The fast food that doesn't look like the picture, the construction that's never really about repairs, the prices that keep climbing while wages don't. He's not a hero and the film knows it, but he's speaking to something that a lot of people feel and don't know how to express. That's what makes it uncomfortable. He's all of us on our worst day, with all the stops removed.
