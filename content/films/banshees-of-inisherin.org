Colm just decides one day that he doesn't want to be Padraic's friend anymore. No big fight, no drama, just... done. And you watch Padraic try to understand it and it's heartbreaking because there's nothing to understand really. Sometimes people just grow apart, or one person realizes they want something different from life, and the other person is left standing there confused. The whole thing feels like a meditation on how we spend our time and who we spend it with.
