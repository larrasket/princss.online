A film completely about its undoing and rebirth. Have never labeled myself a fan of Evangelion, nor has it impacted me like it has for many others, but /Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon a Time/ is by far my favorite Thing from anything Evangelion.

Rating: Cel animation is still better than CGI though
