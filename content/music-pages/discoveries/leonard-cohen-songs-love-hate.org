My ever favorite Cohen album. I discovered him through 'Sing Another Song, Boys' while studying biochemistry in high school. I didn't like it initially but I couldn't stop listening. To this day, chemical formulas intrude into my head whenever I play it. The song is a strange companion, but a faithful one. 'Avalanche' opens the record like a warning.
