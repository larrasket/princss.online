I first learned about this from V for Vendetta (2005), one of my ever favorite films, but didn't pay attention then. I only truly discovered it during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The irony wasn't lost on me. It affects me deeply and gives me vibes from Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. I only play it on special occasions due to its effect on me.
