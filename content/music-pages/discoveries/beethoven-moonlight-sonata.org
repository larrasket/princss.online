The first movement is what everyone knows, that slow, contemplative opening. But the whole piece is a journey. Beethoven wrote this while going deaf, knowing he was losing the thing that mattered most. You can hear that in the music, a kind of beautiful resignation mixed with rage in the final movement. Also essential: Für Elise and Symphony No. 9.
