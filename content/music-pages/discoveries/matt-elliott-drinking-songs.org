My Matt Elliott story is one of the most personal musical journeys I've had. There's something about his voice that sounds like it's coming from the bottom of a well, reaching up. Drinking Songs is devastatingly beautiful. It's slow, deliberate, and feels like grief made audible. I don't listen to it often because it demands too much, but when I do, I give it everything.
