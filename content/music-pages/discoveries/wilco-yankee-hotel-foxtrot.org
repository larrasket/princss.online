Started listening to this album on a whim because I saw how highly praised it was. God this is incredible. It might be one of my favorite albums of all time.

It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's one of the most complete projects I've listened to. I'm not sure how to explain it. I'll be honest, it's usually a hassle to listen to entire album. I often find myself wanting to listen to something else halfway through and then switch to another project by another artist. But this one I listened the whole way through, no pauses.

Jesus, Etc. is easily my favorite song. It's just perfect. It's unexplainable how much it resonated with me, it just hit every beat and activated every neuron in my brain. It captures a certain nostalgic feeling. It's melancholic yet hopeful. Beautiful and sad. Thank God I found this album. I will listen to this for many years to come.
