One of the most unique and breathtaking albums I've ever stumbled across. This project was mentioned in a music podcast that I just started listening to, and good golly Miss Molly am I glad I took a listen.

Something about Mayo Thompson's voice is hypnotic and sort of charming in a way. The folk instrumentation is something worth fawning over too. The lyrics are incredible too. A lot of artists are good at writing like they know how to write good lyrics. Mayo just writes good lyrics. Each verse is just authentically eccentric, no word is wasted. Give this a listen if you're into more avant-garde folk and unique singer-songwriter shit.
