Elliott's music feels like confessions whispered to no one in particular. He had this way of making devastation sound gentle. Between the Bars is maybe the most intimate song about self-destruction ever written. I found him through Either/Or and XO, and his work has become essential listening for those days when you need someone to understand without explaining.
