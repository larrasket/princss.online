My first foray into Brian Eno's music. Very calm, serene, and spacey. Really good reading music. I think I blasted through 40 pages of The Castle in under 2 hours, which is a miracle since it usually takes me 2 days to break 20.

Really beautiful soundscapes. Not familiar with ambient music from the 80's but it surprised me when I found out this was made in 1983. Apparently this was supposed to be a soundtrack for a film about the Apollo mission but most of the tracks on here didn't make the final cut.

Going to listen to a lot more Brian Eno now. Definitely added to the music reading playlist.
