Welcome to my personal website. Here's a link directly to my blog if that was your intended site: <[https://lr0.org/~saleh/](https://lr0.org/~saleh/)> 

>Around the time that he reached the unnerving milestone of turning
>thirty, Leonardo da Vinci wrote a letter to the ruler of Milan listing
>the reasons he should be given a job. He had been moderately successful
>as a painter in Florence, but he had trouble first his commissions
>and was searching for new horizons. In the first ten paragraphs, he
>touted his engineering skills, including his ability to design bridges,
>waterways, cannons, armored vehicles, and public buildings. Only in the
>eleventh paragraph, at the end, did he add that he was also an artist.
>“Likewise in painting I can do everything possible,” he wrote.
