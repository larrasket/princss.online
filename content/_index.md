Hello, and welcome to my castle! This is a place where all of my thoughts and interests and projects live. This site may sometimes change often -- just because I'm an indecisive person by nature -- but for the most part, the content will stay the same.

I don't often talk about **mature content**, but just as a precaution, you have been **warned**! This site *may* contain content that is not suitable for those who are squeamish or five years old.

I have been learning html and css for a couple years now, and so far this is the culmination of all those years of learning. I still don't know much, but that's the project of this whole thing: just learning how to do the things that I want to do -- such as write, code, make stuff, etc. Have fun exploring!
