#+title: Portrait of a North African (1870)

[[id:eaphdi80xlk0][Alexandre Cabanel]] has a painting of this name depicting a black man with
some North African features. What interests me that it has a name on the top
right, it reads like: محمد بن الدبم. I wonder who is that and how the
interaction between him and Cabanel went like. #[[id:mvk9gc7014k0][Art]]
