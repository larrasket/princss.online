Form [[id:npl4k8k0elk0][Papers and journals]]: "Encounter on 30 Nov., when they were doing Two Days,
with an unknown but beautiful lady (she spoke German) – she was alone in the
stalls with a little brother – she understood the music." It's an interesting
remark. It's really interesting to see someone who understands the music.
