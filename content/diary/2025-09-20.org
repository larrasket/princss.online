#+title: Cast Away (2000) is an amazing film.

I spent last night rewatching Cast Away. The last time I watched it was when I was lost, my perception about it was alike the one I had to other mainstream films that his return to life was not respectful to everyone around him (i.e. main character delima). What I could remember before my watch was something like that her wife either stays with her new husband, or she leaves her new husband for him, both are equally awful. But the ending doesn't show Kelly leaving her new husband. Instead, there's a bittersweet final meeting between Chuck and Kelly where they acknowledge their love for each other, but Kelly chooses to stay with her current family. Chuck ultimately lets her go and drives away to start his new life. The film ends with Chuck at a crossroads (literally and figuratively), suggesting hope for his future as he decides which direction to take. #[[id:kwlj2jo02wj0][Cinema]]
