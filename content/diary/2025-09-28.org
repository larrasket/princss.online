#[[id:3xifm2g0kpk0][The Romans in their Decadence]] I really like this painting a lot, but I fail to properly interpret it. Do you know a good interpretation? Share it in the email please (this applies also if you're reading this post in a distant future, I keep track of long old TODOs). #[[id:mvk9gc7014k0][Art]]
