#+title: Emacs M4 Experience

Using Intel processor for all these years, which is quite slow compared to Apple
Chips, made me spend a lot of work to optimize my single-threaded favorite
display editor. The experience was pleasant overall, but using it now on a very
fast computer, it is not just pleasant it is blazingly fast. The difference is
just unimaginable. #[[id:4ly8im40gzj0][Emacs]]
