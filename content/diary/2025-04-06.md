Hello! Long time no write.

Since the last post, a lot of things have changed: I now live with my girlfriend. I moved into my own apartment. I'm in a new city. I'm a completely different person. Very exciting.

I just realized today -- my new home actually has a lot of parallels to my old one. In fact, our apartment is the same unit style as my old apartment I lived in with my parents when I was younger. It has the same layout. Our room mirrors my old one; I was talking to Bree about it on Easter. Maybe my subconscious was steering me towards this apartment all along. Maybe I've always looked for home.

Home home home home. That's another word for me to play with.

<h2>the world</h2>

I've slowly started to become more and more disenchanted with American politics. These past few years have actually drove me insane. It's beyond bleak and I feel like I have to make a choice between my mental health and "staying informed." Hopefully, in the next few entries, I might write about world happenings. We'll see.
