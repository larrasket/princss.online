#+title:  Skies in Alexey Bogolyubov works

The art works of Aagaard are very touching, it reminds me of my old town, some obscure places in which you wold only notice such moments that are in his paintings. It is sad that most of them are not available in high quality online, probably purchased in some rich palaces around the world. #[[id:mvk9gc7014k0][Art]] #[[id:akcl6pw0ekk0][Carl Aagaard]]
