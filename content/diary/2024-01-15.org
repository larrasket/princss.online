#+title: 'The reason I hate nature'

My friend sent me this episode from a pop-science +TV+ series [Arabic]; https://youtu.be/CFeW61i_MLA it has English subtitle. I'd love to share [[id:1634e2c7-c5aa-44bf-b0c7-00ff078366f3][Nietzsche]] view of the matter[cite:@DawnofDay no. 17]: Goodness and malignity. At first men imposed their own personalities on Nature: everywhere they saw themselves and their like, i.e. their own evil and capricious temperaments, hidden, as it were, behind clouds, thunder-storms, wild beasts, trees, and plants: it was then that they declared Nature was evil. Afterwards there came a time, that of Rousseau, when they sought to distinguish themselves from Nature: they were so tired of each other that they wished to have separate little hiding-places where man and his misery could not penetrate: then they invented “nature is good.” #[[id:tixkcwk0gwj0][The Power of Understanding Human Nature]]
