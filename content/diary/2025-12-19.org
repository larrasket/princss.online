TIL that Constanze Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wife, was married latter to Nikolaus Von Nissen, one of the people who admired Mozart a lot and worked on writing a biography for him. I'm wondering if he liked the man that much to marry the same woman who lived with him, or did he just used her for his project, or, in fact, loved her. #[[id:lfoaq730yck0][Music]] #[[id:78903b85-1d2d-4564-8c37-7183fa55c617][History]]
