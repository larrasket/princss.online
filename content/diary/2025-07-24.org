#+title: View of the Pont au Change from Quai de Gesvres by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot

View of the Pont au Change from Quai de Gesvres by [[id:48iifil01nk0][Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot]] I noticed how almost all Corot paintings are not very colorful, his era is the beginning of less vibrant art. #[[id:mvk9gc7014k0][Art]]
