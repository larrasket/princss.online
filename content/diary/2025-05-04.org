#+title:Paintings of Giuseppe Abbati
[[id:2m761qw05kk0][The Massacre of the Monks of Tamond by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] origins --
I liked this painting a lot and I felt the urge to learn more about its history, but looks like we do not know anything about what Alma-Tadema refered to there, he was 19 years old when he painted it. It's either:  A fictional or imagined scene created by Lawrence Alma-Tadema early in his career, or a reference to a now-obscure historical or legendary episode—possibly medieval or religious in nature—that hasn't survived in mainstream records. #[[id:mvk9gc7014k0][Art]] #[[id:bc7b4p21tik0][Giuseppe Abbati]]
