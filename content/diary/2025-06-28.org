#+title:Myth of Phantom Thread (2017)

I found a claim that [[https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/55650/69248][women in Middle Ages Europe used to poison their husbands
to keep them close]]. I watched [[id:g1af8q93nur2][Phantom Thread (2017)]] a couple of months ago,
which had a similar theme to this claim. I wounder if it was inspired by this
myth. Phantom Thread is one of the movies that I don't think I will ever have
the courage to rewatch. #[[id:kwlj2jo02wj0][Cinema]]
