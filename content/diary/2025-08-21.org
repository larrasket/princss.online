[[https://youtu.be/uuCoyILqut8]["Life is tremendously sad"]] While I don't totally agree with his life perception,
I really love how Louie is so consistant on his philosophy. I'm pretty sure that
the show was written with an intense care for ideas and different philosophies,
as it even discusses many moral issues as of the course of it. This same part
that louie talks about here in the video reminded me of that episode (too lazy
to reference the exact one) when his Hungarian girlfriend leaves, and he tells
the doctor about it and the doctor [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VIPKVdUK40][tells him]] that what he feels now is "love",
or like he puts it in the linked reference: "Sadness is poetic, you're lucky to
live sad moments".
