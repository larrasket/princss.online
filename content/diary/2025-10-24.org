#+title: Is everything okay back home?

I have never been asked this question, but I think it's extra scary. So scary that I think about it even I was not questioned. My problem with this question is simple; it does not only imply that you are being a disappointment and a failure, but it also tells about you that you are not responsible that you are still willing to produce, work, or go to the exam, even when you know you can not do your best, due to your presumed "back home" situation. It's a question of dignity too, not only performance.
