#+title: Be Right There

The Be Right There episode is probably the most heartbreaking episode of Black
Mirror. I was rewatching it right now. I just noticed how Jack gave his mother a
fake smile in that old photo, the girlfriend says "Well, she didn't know it was
a fake one", "That makes it worse" he responded. Which is the whole point of the
episode. I love this kind of symbolism. #[[id:4swh72s0s1k0][Postmodern Abyss: Black Mirror]]
