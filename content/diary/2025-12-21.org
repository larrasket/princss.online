#+title: Device is left behind.

Apparently, if you go somewhere far from home (or any usual stay place) with multiple Apple devices and leave one behind, the FindMy App alerts: "device left behind"
The irony is my MacBook  is named "saleh" so the notification says: "saleh is left behind" and idk about that
