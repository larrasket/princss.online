#+title: Introduction the theory of value

[[id:mmyjm240dnk0][This]] is an LLM written introduction into the theory of value. It's easy to
understand and I thought it might be useful for people who want to quickly
understand how value works. "Workers don't own what they produce.  The products
of their labor become commodities owned by capitalists and sold back to workers
in the market." for me, this part is the most painful, when I work under a
capitalist system.
