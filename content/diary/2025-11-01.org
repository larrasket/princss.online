#+title: Embarrassing music

I just noticed that there are some artists that I would 'love' listening to, but I feel to embarrassed looking them up (and I can't answer why, because there's really no obvious reason for this feeling for me), so I been doing something uncanny; I would open Apple's random selections for me (aka. station), start the playback, and hope that it will pass by that artist or that song at some point. #[[id:lfoaq730yck0][Music]]
