#+title: Autuman, George Eliot

Is not this a true autumn day? Just the still melancholy that I love—that makes life and nature harmonise. The birds are consulting about their migrations, the trees are putting on the hectic or the pallid hues of decay, and begin to strew the ground, that one’s very footsteps may not disturb the repose of earth and air, while they give us a scent that is a perfect anodyne to the restless spirit. Delicious autumn! My very soul is wedded to it, and if I were a bird I would fly about the earth seeking the successive autumns. - Letter to Maria Lewis. #[[id:6318fd43-4f0d-4c3b-9c83-5cadbeca2260][Literature]] #[[id:ydb1kfn02wj0][Modus Vivendi]]
