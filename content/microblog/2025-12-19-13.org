#+title: Mulan (1998)

There's an observation that I thought about as a kid watching that movie,
powerful training montage where Mulan is struggling to complete the challenge of
retrieving an arrow from the top of a tall wooden pole. The movie supposed to go
in the theme that after some life-changing exercises, effort, and most
importantly mindset, she is finally able to do this very hard challenge. But She
actually were never able to, what happens instead is that instead of letting the
weights drag her down, she uses them as tools. She loops the straps of the
weights together to form a grip, anchoring herself on the pole. While this sounds
smart and everything; it is not what the exercise is meant for, otherwise there
would be many other smarter and easier ways to get the arrow, the exercise was
meant for bare brute strength, not thinking differently. #[[id:kwlj2jo02wj0][Cinema]]
