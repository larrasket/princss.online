#+title: Louie/Letterman [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_(Louie)][(Late Show)]]

The Late Show episodes from the Louie show are really interesting. They give me
a deep gloomy vibe as they used to when I watched them for the first time. For
some reason I believed that this really happened with Louie CK in the real life,
but I think it might be symbolic to something else. Funny enough that I used to
watch it when I started interviewing for the first time, so it was very
relevant. It was also the reason why I stopped watching Louie. I remember asking
Antar: "Hey, is it going to be depressive starting from season 3?".
