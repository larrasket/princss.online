* [[id:c50fn50104k0][Democracy]] and Spectator Democracy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: democracy-and-spectator-democracy
:END:
The role of the media in contemporary politics forces us to ask what
kind of a world and what kind of a society we want to live in, and in
particular in what sense of democracy do we want this to be a democratic
society? Let me begin by counter-posing two different conceptions of
democracy. One conception of democracy has it that a democratic society
is one in which the public has the means to participate in some
meaningful way in the management of their own affairs and the means of
information are open and free. If you look up democracy in the
dictionary you'll get a definition something like that.

An alternative conception of democracy is that the public must be barred
from managing of their own affairs and the means of information must be
kept narrowly and rigidly con- trolled. That may sound like an odd
conception of democracy, but it's important to understand that it is the
prevailing conception. In fact, it has long been, not just in operation,
but even in theory. There's a long history that goes back to the
earliest modern democratic revolutions in seventeenth century England
which largely expresses this point of view. I'm just going to keep to
the modern period and say a few words about how that notion of democracy
develops and why and how the problem of media and dis- information
enters within that context.

Another group that was impressed by these successes was liberal
democratic theorists and leading media figures, like, for example,
Walter Lippmann, who was the dean of American journalists, a major
foreign and domestic pol- icy critic and also a major theorist of
liberal democracy. If you take a look at his collected essays, you'll
see that they're subtitled some- thing like "A Progressive Theory of
Liberal Democratic Thought." Lippmann was involved in these propaganda
commissions and recognized their achievements. He argued that what he
called a "revolution in the art of democracy," could be used to
"manufacture consent," that is, to bring about agreement on the part of
the public for things that they didn't want by the new techniques of
propaganda. He also thought that this was a good idea, in fact,
necessary. It was necessary because, as he put it, *"the common
interests elude public opinion entirely" and can only be understood and
managed by a "specialized class"of 'responsible men' who are smart
enough to figure things out.*

This 'democracy' asserts that only a small elite, the intellectual
community that the Deweyites were talking about, can understand the
common interests, what all of us care about, and that these things
"elude the general public."

** Election as a 'Democracy'

Lippmann backed this up by a pretty elaborated theory of progressive
democracy. He argued that in a properly functioning democracy there are
classes of citizens. There is first of all the class of citizens who
have to take some active role in running general affairs. That's the
specialized class. They are the people who analyze, execute, make
decisions, and run things in the political, economic, and ideological
systems. That's a small percentage of the population. Naturally, anyone
who puts these ideas forth is always part of that small group, and
they're talking about what to do about those others. Those others, who
are out of the small group, the big majority of the population, they are
what Lippmann called /“the bewildered herd./” We have to protect
ourselves from "the trampling and roar of a bewildered herd". Now there
are two "functions" in a democracy: *The specialized class,* the
responsible men, carry out the executive function, which means they do
the thinking and planning and understand the common interests. Then,
there is the bewildered herd, and they have a function in democracy too.
Their function in a democracy, he said, is to be "spectators," not
participants in action. But they have more of a function than that,
because it's a democracy. *Occasionally they are allowed to lend their
weight to one or another member of the specialized class. In other
words, they're allowed to say, "We want you to be our leader" or "We
want you to be our leader." That's because it's a democracy and not a
totalitarian state. That's called an election. But once they've lent
their weight to one or another member of the specialized class they're
sup- posed to sink back and become spectators of action, but not
participants. That's in a properly functioning democracy.*

* 'Support our troops' and Abandon the Wicked Socialists

:END:
In 1937. There was a major strike, the Steel strike in western
Pennsylvania at Johnstown. Business tried out a new technique of labor
destruction, which worked very well. Not through goon squads and
breaking knees. That wasn't working very well any more, but through the
more subtle and effective means of propaganda. The idea was to figure
out ways to turn the public against the strikers, to present the
strikers as disruptive, harmful to the public and against the common
interests. The common interests are those of "us," the businessman, the
worker, the housewife. That's all "us." We want to be together and have
things like harmony and Americanism and working together. Then there's
those bad strikers out there who are disruptive and causing trouble and
breaking harmony and violating Americanism. We've got to stop them so we
can all live together. The corporate executive and the guy who cleans
the floors all have the same interests. We can all work together and
work for Americanism in harmony, liking each other.

That was essentially the message. A huge amount of effort was put into
presenting it. This is, after all, the business community, so they
control the media and have massive resources. And it worked, very
effectively. It was later called the "Mohawk Valley formula" and applied
over and over again to break strikes. They were called "scientific
methods of strike-breaking," and worked very effectively by mobilizing
community opinion in favor of vapid, empty concepts like American- ism.
Who can be against that? Or harmony. Who can be against that? Or, as in
the Persian Gulf War, "Support our troops." Who can be against that? Or
yellow ribbons. Who can be against that? Anything that's totally
vacuous.

In fact, what does it mean if somebody asks you, Do you support the
people in Iowa? Can you say, Yes, I support them, or No, I don't support
them? It's not even a question. It doesn't mean anything. That's the
point. The point of public relations slogans like "Support our troops"
is that *they don't mean anything. They mean as much as whether you
support the people in Iowa Of course, there was an issue. The issue was,
Do you support our policy? But you don't want people to think about that
issue. That's the whole point of good propaganda.*

There are no political parties or organizations. It's a long way toward
the ideal, at least structurally. The media are a corporate monopoly.
They have the same point of view. The two par- ties are two factions of
the business party. Most of the population doesn't even bother voting
because it looks meaningless. They're marginalized and properly
distracted. At least that's the goal. The leading figure in the public
relations industry, Edward Bernays, actually came out of the Creel
Commission. He was part of it, learned his lessons there and went on to
develop what he called the "engineering of con- sent," which he
described as "the essence of democracy." *The people who are able to
engineer consent are the ones who have the resources and the power to do
it---the business community---and that's who you work for.*

* It Works

One indication of how much efficient is our propaganda was revealed in a
study done at the University of Massachusetts on attitudes toward the
current Gulf crisis---a study of beliefs and attitudes in television
watching. One of the questions asked in that study was, How many
Vietnamese casualties would you estimate that there were during the
Vietnam war? The average response on the part of Americans today is
about /100,000./ The official figure is about two million. The actual
figure is probably three to four million. The people who conducted the
study raised an appropriate question: What would we think about German
political culture if, when you asked people today how many Jews died in
the Holocaust, they estimated about 300,000? What would that tell us
about German political culture? They leave the question unanswered, but
you can pursue it. What does it tell us about our culture? It tells us
quite a bit.

Another example happened in May 1986 the memoirs of the released Cuban
prisoner, Armando Valladares, came out. They quickly became a media
sensation. I'll give you a couple of quotes. The media described his
revelations as "the definitive account of the vast system of torture and
prison by which Castro punishes and obliterates political opposition."
It was "an inspiring and unforgettable account" of the "bestial
prisons," inhuman torture, [and] record of state violence [under] yet
another of this century's mass murderers, who we learn, at last, from
this book "has created a new despotism that has institutionalized
torture as a mechanism of social control" in "the hell that was the Cuba
that [Valladares] lived in." That's the Washington Post and New York
Times in repeated reviews.

Let's say it's all true. Let's raise no questions about what happened to
the one man who says he was tortured. At a White House ceremony marking
Human Rights Day, he was singled out by Ronald Reagan for his courage in
enduring the horrors and sadism of this bloody Cuban tyrant. *He was
then appointed the U.S. representative at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, where he has been able to per- form signal services
defending the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments against charges that
they conduct atrocities so massive that they make anything he suffered
look pretty minor. That's the way things stand.*

That was May 1986. It was interesting, and it tells you something about
the manufacture of consent. The same month, the surviving members of the
Human Rights Group of El Salvador---the leaders had been killed---were
arrested and tortured, including Herbert Anaya, who was the director.
They were sent to a prison---La Esperanza (hope) Prison. While they were
in prison they continued their human rights work. They were lawyers,
they continued taking affidavits. There were 432 prisoners in that
prison. They got signed affidavits from 430 of them in which they
described, under oath, the torture that they had received: electrical
torture and other atrocities, *including, in one case, torture by a
North American U.S. major in uni- form, who is described in some
detail.* This is an unusually explicit and comprehensive testimony,
probably unique in its detail about what's going on in a torture
chamber. This 160-page report of the prisoners' sworn testimony was
sneaked out of prison, along with a videotape which was taken showing
people testifying in prison about their torture. It was dis- tributed by
the Marin County Interfaith Task Force. The national press refused to
cover it. The TV stations refused to run it. There was an article in the
local Marin County newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, and I think
that's all. No one else would touch it. This was a time when there was
more than a few "light-headed and cold-blooded Western intellectuals"
who were singing the praises of Jose Napoleon Duarte and of Ronald
Reagan. *Anaya was not the subject of any tributes. He didn't get on
Human Rights Day. He wasn't appointed to anything. He was released in a
prisoner exchange and then assassinated, apparently by the U.S.-backed
security forces. Very little information about that ever appeared. The
media never asked whether exposure of the atrocities---instead of
sitting on them and silencing them---might have saved his life.*[fn:1]

Another example is the Israeli terrorism even out of Palestine,
perceived during the Gulf War. In February 1991, right in the middle of
the bombing campaign, the government of Lebanon requested Israel to
observe U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which called on it to
withdraw immediately and unconditionally from Lebanon. That resolution
dates from March 1978. There have since been two subsequent resolutions
calling for the immediate and unconditional with- drawal of Israel from
Lebanon. Of course it doesn't observe them because the United States
backs it in maintaining that occupation. Meanwhile southern Lebanon is
terrorized. There are big torture-chambers with horrifying things going
on. It's used as a base for attacking other parts of Lebanon. Since
1978, Lebanon was invaded, the city of Beirut was bombed, *about 20,000
people were killed, about 80 percent of them civilians, hospitals were
destroyed, and more terror, looting, and robbery was inflicted.* All
fine, the United States backed it. *That's just one case. You didn't see
anything in the media about it or any discussion about whether Israel
and the United States should observe U.N. Security Council Resolution
425 or any of the other resolutions, nor did anyone call for the bombing
of Tel Aviv, although by the principles upheld by two-thirds of the
population, we should. After all, that's illegal occupation and severe
human rights abuses. That's just one case. There are much worse ones.
The Indonesian invasion of East Timor knocked off about 200,000 people.
They all look minor by that one. That was strongly backed by the United
States and is still going on with major United States diplomatic and
military support. We can go on and on.*

Do you remember the University of Massachusetts study that I mentioned
before? It has some interesting conclusions. In the study people were
asked whether they thought that the United States should intervene with
force to /reverse illegal occupation or serious human rights abuses./ By
about two to one, people in the United States thought we should. They
should use force in the case of illegal occupation of land and severe
human rights abuses. If the United States was to follow that advice,
they would bomb El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Damascus, Tel Aviv,
Capetown, Turkey, Washington, and a whole list of other states.

       this story, it was not covered at all by any of these
