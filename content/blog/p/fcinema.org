* [2024-09-02 Mon 03:54] Update Note
- [2025-04-29 Tue 02:31] Today I'm starting my plan to rewatch everything. I hope I will get a good
  perspective.
This page has gone through many modifications and drops, mainly because I got to change my
mind a lot about cinema as an entertainment industry. Upon reading [[id:jhxdza81e3k0][Leo Tolstoy]]'s "[[id:v32cm1u09bk0][What is
art?]]" I began to have a better view on cinema. In nutshell:

- I discern cinema works into two categories: intellectual works and entertainment
  ones.
- Entertainment cinema. Though it does not resonate with my personal inclinations
  and often strikes me as a great waste of time, it does not inherently
  contravene moral or ethical boundaries.
- Intellectual cinema operates on a higher plane of artistic ambition and philosophical
  inquiry. It aspires to provoke thought, challenge perceptions, and engage with profound
  questions about ethics and one's existence. However (and here's the important point
  here), the pursuit of artistic authenticity must be critically examined when it crosses
  the boundaries of human dignity. The objectification of individuals—whether through the
  gratuitous depiction of nudity, the exploitation of unsimulated sexual acts, or any
  other means that commodify the human body—represents an ethical transgression that
  cannot be justified under the guise of artistic integrity. Art that seeks to illuminate
  the human condition must do so without degrading the very essence of humanity it seeks
  to portray.

That's being said, I do have regret to what I've done to this list, which used to, in
fact, very complete. Today ([2024-09-02 Mon 14:10]) I will work on rebuilding it again. It
will have initially two sections: Underwhelming Watches and Memorable Gems. The latter is
the one which is going to have the titles that got me invested/interested in important
questions. Movies that applies to "Unethical use of art" will be marked under the "UUA" section.

*** KILL RESTRICT                                                    :@else:

07 Oct, 2022. I still believe that this list need to purged, I've many possible
thoughts to do that, all of them are so applicable and should be easy to me, but
sadly I can hardly write line of JS code to implement any of them. Thus I'm left
with writing compiled code to generate static HTML, which is tough (to me).

Most important, however, is that there is mainly two types of cinema works
here: 1. intellectual works. 2. consumption works. Please do not watch any of
type 2, and do not pick until I filter them myself.
*** 19 Aug, 2021 Log

i feel that this list being very redundant by the time, I wish if I had enough
time to build more-scalable database or software to maintain it.
