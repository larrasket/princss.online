Following are quick notes I toke while reading the first volume of Chekhov's
selected works. I might add notes for the rest of the book later.

- After the Theater :: "Onyegin was interesting because he was not in love at
  all, and Tatyana was fascinating because she was so much in love; but if they
  had been equally in love with each other and had been happy, they would
  perhaps have seemed dull".

- The Runaway :: Reminded me of an old memory with my father at the dentist. I
  loved the vibes.

- Volodya :: Very strange story. I think I should read some analysis for it, but I have not got any time for that.

- The Boys

- Enemies

- Malingerers

- العازف الأجير

- Vanka

- A Naughty Boy

- The Trousseau
- Agafya :: Aesthetic story, I want to live in a world like the one Chekhov
  describes there.
- A Misfortune :: One of the saddest stories I've ever read. Really moved me.
