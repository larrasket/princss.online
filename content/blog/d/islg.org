After playing for a while with [cite:@norvig-1991-parad] it got me interested in
learning more about statistical learning, one of the most common frameworks for
machine learning. [cite:@gareth-2023-introd-statis-learn] gives a very
thorough introduction with application using the Python programming language
(yes, the book name is pretty descriptive).

While I enjoy the book, I rarely enjoy writing Python. Here I provide my notes
and exercise solutions for the book using both the Go and Julia programming
languages.
