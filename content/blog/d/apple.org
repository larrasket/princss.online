I believe that the software products that Apple builds are some of the most
well-engineered, well-designed, and well-written software ever. And I think
there are some reasons for that, most of them are not good ones:

1. Apple products are massively overpriced, which creates a significant surplus
   that allows them to invest heavily in software development. Capitalism
   rewards monopolistic pricing, and Apple has mastered the art of leveraging
   brand power and exclusivity to justify insane markups. Unlike something like
   Linux, which I’ve used for a long time, open-source projects struggle to get
   consistent funding or sponsorship, making it much harder to compete at the
   same level.
2. Apple does not care about backward compatibility, worldwide compatibility, or
   anything else outside its walled garden. Their software is built to work
   exclusively on Apple hardware, and they have zero interest in making it
   usable for non-Apple users. They also deprecate anything older than seven
   years, forcing people into costly upgrades. As someone who has worked
   extensively with system architecture and design, I can confirm that a
   significant amount of engineering effort typically goes into maintaining
   backward compatibility and ensuring interoperability with the rest of the
   tech ecosystem. By outright ignoring these two concerns, Apple engineers get
   to focus almost entirely on UX, making their software feel smoother and more
   polished than competitors.
3. Since (1), Apple can afford to invest in developing much better SDKs, which
   ensures that software built on their platforms is high quality. This is why
   you often find software that exists on both Apple’s OSs and other operating
   systems but still runs better on Apple’s—because their development tools and
   ecosystem are simply better funded. This also attracts top-tier developers
   who prefer the stability and optimization of Apple’s environment, further
   reinforcing their advantage.
4. Apple controls both the hardware and the software, which means they don’t
   have to deal with the same fragmentation issues that plague other ecosystems.
   Unlike Windows or Android, where developers have to account for a ridiculous
   range of hardware variations, Apple’s tight integration allows them to
   optimize performance and deliver a more cohesive experience. However, this
   comes at the cost of user freedom—if Apple decides they don’t want you
   running certain apps or repairing your own device, you’re out of luck.
5. The cult-like marketing and closed ecosystem trap users into staying within
   Apple’s platform. iMessage lock-in, proprietary file formats, restrictive App
   Store policies—everything is designed to make switching inconvenient. This
   means Apple doesn’t just create good software; they create software that
   *feels* indispensable, even when there are equal or better alternatives
   elsewhere.

Apple's software is good. Sometimes too good. But the reasons behind it are far
less about pure engineering brilliance and far more about strategic corporate
control, aggressive pricing, and an ecosystem that thrives on exclusivity. #[[id:4u5664n02wj0][Programming]] #[[id:fxy2iw81lik0][Apple]]
