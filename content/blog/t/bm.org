#+CAPTION: It is said that a horse will reflect back to you what is in your heart. This is why it symbolizes the shadow side, or dark side, because any impurities come to the surface when gazed upon. It is essential to see this side of ourselves if we want to rid ourselves of any impurities, therefore it is also the most truthful and self-aware. source: http://www.vincentfink.com/2020/01/05/black-mirror-bee-episode-hated-in-the-nation/

#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
'Black Mirror' confronts viewers with uncomfortable truths about their
relationship with technology and modernism, paralleling a critique of prevailing
moral values. It challenges the very fabric of existence. The series beckons
humanity to confront the ethical dilemmas embedded in our pursuit of
advancement, blurring the lines between progress and our moral decay.
#+END_PREVIEW

Black Mirror is one of the cinematic works that I personally believe has a very
high level of /subliminal messaging/ in a way that makes it has a large domain
of viewers (which is a main interest for publishers, for revenues) but still
present a sophisticated philosophical assertion. It might relate for the popular
movie —that I admire as well— V for Vendetta (2005) which many people liked for
different reasons: the action adventure, the ambiguous relationship, the
anarchism vibes, the anti-anarchism vibes (catholic monarchist V).
