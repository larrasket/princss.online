#+begin_quote
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.
3. Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and
   mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not
   be marked).
4. Find the smallest number in the list greater than p that is not marked. If
   there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number
   (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list
   are all the primes below n.

** Zeno's Paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       zgjcnsh0x8k0
:END:
Sometime around the fifth century B.C., the Greek philosopher Zeno posed a
paradox that now bears his name. Suppose that Achilles and a tortoise are to run
a footrace. Let’s assume that Achilles is exactly twice as fast as the tortoise.
(Our tortoise is obviously a veritable Hercules among his kind.) To make things
fair, the tortoise will get a head start of 1000 meters. After the start of the
race, by the time Achilles runs 1000 meters, the tortoise is still ahead by 500
meters. However, Achilles is a far superior athlete, so he easily covers the
next 500 meters. During this time, the tortoise has managed to go another 250
meters. We can repeat the process for an infinite number of time slices while
always finding the tortoise just a bit ahead of Achilles. Will Achilles ever
catch up to the tortoise?

In other words, what this paradox is actually questioning is whether an infinite
number of $x$ (in this case, time slices) can even occur when thinking of it
mathematically. Zeno has structured the same paradox in another way, assume that
you are moving an object from $p_1$ to $p_24, at some point the object has
reached half the distance to $p_2$ then one-third to $p_2$, then one to the
forth of $p_2$ and so to infinite number of the fractions to which the object
will reach $p_2$, we know that's impossible to reach the end of something that
has the attribute of infinitude, so will even $p_2$ be reached?

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots
\]

And the answer to this paradox is fairly simple in modern algebra, as we know
that having something that has the attribute of infinitude, does not imply that
this thing has an infinite sum. Take for example this box:

[[file:../../media/Notes/2024-06-30_16-25-56_screenshot.png]]

We can see that the right portion of the box is exactly equal to its left, we
note too that the right portion has an infinite continuation of division,
however we know too that this infinite division will sum up to $0.5$ no matter
what.
** Prime Numbers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       rjh37zn0y8k0
:END:
A prime number is a positive integer, which is divisible on 1 and itself. The
other integers, greater than 1, are composite. Coprime integers are a set of
integers that have no common divisor other than 1 or -1.
*** Euclid’s theorem
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       hosg3qo0y8k0
:END:
There is no largest prime number.

To prove this, let’s consider only n prime numbers: $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_n$. But no prime
$p_i$ divides the number

N = p1 * p2 * … * pn + 1,

so N cannot be composite. This contradicts the fact that the set of primes is
finite.
*** Sieve of Eratosthenes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1f616qo0y8k0
:END:
The most efficient way to find all small primes was proposed by the Greek
mathematician Eratosthenes. His idea was to make a list of positive integers not
greater than n and sequentially strike out the multiples of primes less than or
equal to the square root of n. After this procedure only primes are left in the
list.

Here's a [[id:911epup02wj0][Julia]] implementation:

#+begin_src example
function sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
    is_prime = trues(limit)
    is_prime[1] = false  # 1 is not a prime number

    for i in 2:sqrt(limit)
        if is_prime[i]
            for j in i^2:i:limit
                is_prime[j] = false
            end
        end
    end

    primes = []
    for i in 2:limit
        if is_prime[i]
            push!(primes, i)

*** Prime Numbers Theorem
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       g58jq4r0y8k0
:END:
The prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the
prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that
primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the
rate at which this occurs.

The first such distribution found is π(N) ~ N / log(N) , where π(N) is the
prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to N) and
log(N) is the natural logarithm of N. This means that for large enough N, the
probability that a random integer not greater than N is prime is very close to 1
/ log(N).

** Kaprekar's constant
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       59m80xb009k0
:END:
The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar. This number is renowned for the following rule:

1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed).
2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.
3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.
4. Go back to step 2 and repeat.

The above process, known as Kaprekar's routine, will always reach its fixed
point, 6174, in at most 7 iterations.[4] Once 6174 is reached, the process will
continue yielding 7641 – 1467 = 6174. For example, choose 1459:

9541 – 1459 = 8082
8820 – 0288 = 8532
8532 – 2358 = 6174
7641 – 1467 = 6174

** Prefect Numbers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fy80cm9049k0
:END:
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the
sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number
itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6
is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
= 28.

** Mersenne Primes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       u9qear9049k0
:END:
In mathematics, a *Mersenne prime* is a prime number that is one less than a
power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form /M _{n}/ = 2 ^{/n/} − 1
for some integer /n/. They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar,
who studied them in the early 17th century. If /n/ is a composite number then so
is 2 ^{/n/} − 1. Therefore, an equivalent definition of the Mersenne primes is
that they are the prime numbers of the form /M _{p}/ = 2 ^{/p/} − 1 for some
prime /p/.

Mersenne primes Mp are closely connected to [[id:fy80cm9049k0][Prefect Numbers]]. In the 4th century
BC, Euclid proved that if 2p − 1 is prime, then 2^p − 1(2^p − 1) is a perfect
number.

** Googol and GoogolPlex

:END:

A googol is the large number 10^100. In decimal notation, it is written as the
digit 1 followed by one hundred zeroes. A googol is a very big number, more than
humans can imagine. For example if you think of how many grains of sand you can
fit in a big room,  well not that big, it will be around in the range of 30-100
billion. Not that big. Less that a Googol. What about the number of all
particles in the universe, that's about 10^80, this is still less than a Googol.
Okay how about a universe filled of grains of sand? that will be about 10^90,
which is still less than a Googol. A Googolplex is a 10^(Googol). It's a very
big number that if we use every particular in the universe to write one of its
zeros, we won't be able to write it all down.

Grigori Perelmans solved the Poincaré conjecture but declined the prizes for it. From
wikipeda:

#+begin_quote
However, Perelman declined to accept the prize. Sir John Ball, president of the
International Mathematical Union, approached Perelman in Saint Petersburg in June 2006 to
persuade him to accept the prize. After 10 hours of attempted persuasion over two days,
Ball gave up. Two weeks later, Perelman summed up the conversation as follows: "He
proposed to me three alternatives: accept and come; accept and don't come, and we will
send you the medal later; third, I don't accept the prize. From the very beginning, I told
him I have chosen the third one ... [the prize] was completely irrelevant for me.
Everybody understood that if the proof is correct, then no other recognition is
needed." He was quoted as saying, "'I'm not interested in money or fame, I don't want
to be on display like an animal in a zoo. I'm not a hero of mathematics. I'm not even that
successful; that is why I don't want to have everybody looking at me.'

*** Platnoism Numbers
Mathematical Platonism is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are
abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging.
This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term Platonism is
used because such a view is seen to parallel Plato's Theory of Forms and a "World of
Ideas" (Greek: eidos (εἶδος)) described in Plato's allegory of the cave: the everyday
world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave
and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas
were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular Pythagoreans of ancient
Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by numbers.
*** fictionalism
Mathematical fictionalism was brought to fame in 1980 when Hartry Field published Science
Without Numbers,[57] which rejected and in fact reversed Quine's indispensability
argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific
theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently
existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should
be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by
giving a complete axiomatization of Newtonian mechanics with no reference to numbers or
functions at all. He started with the "betweenness" of Hilbert's axioms to characterize
space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the
work formerly done by vector fields. Hilbert's geometry is mathematical, because it talks
about abstract points, but in Field's theory, these points are the concrete points of
physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.
