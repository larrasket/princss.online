   #+begin_verse
 There once was a programmer named Joe
 Who loved coding in Go, don't you know?
 He found it quite neat
 With concurrency sweet
 And a syntax that was oh so low-key

 With goroutines running in parallel
 His code ran faster than a serial
 He could handle many tasks
 With ease and with panache
 Thanks to Go's ability to scale.

 So if you want your code to be lean
 And run faster than you've ever seen
 Give Go a try
 And watch your code fly
 And see what it can do for your machine
