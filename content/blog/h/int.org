#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
Learning is the change taking place in a system; it can be either permanent
improvement of the systematic work or permanent change in the behavior of
the organism.
#+END_PREVIEW
In a complicated system, a change in learning is due to many
reasons; that is to say, there are many forms of the learning process in the
same system, and its different parts will undergo different improvements.
People can set new production rules and set up new behaviors.


Following figure provides a proposed framework for learning.

The principle of learning is that the learner must know the last result,
i.e. whether the behavior can be improved. It’s better for learner to get
information about which parts of the behavior are satisfied and which parts
are not.


* Learning theories
The following is a brief introduction to a list of the most widely-known
learning theories.
** Behaviorism

The characteristics of the theory are as follows:

1. It emphasizes that psychology is a science, so we should pay attention to
   experiment and observation in method and only observe and record the explicit
   behavior in the research subject.
2. The basis of explaining constitutive behavior is the individual’s external
   reaction, and the formation and change of the reaction is the course of
   restriction.
3. Paying attention to the influence of environment on individual behavior and
   not recognizing the importance of individual free will are regarded as
   determinism.
4. In education, it advocates both reward and punishment, neglects internal
   motivation, and emphasizes the training value of external control.
   Behaviorism became popular in the United States and extended to the

Behaviorism is a significant learning theory that has greatly contributed to our
understanding of human behavior and the learning process. It emphasizes the role
of observable behaviors and external stimuli in shaping and modifying behavior.
Behaviorism has provided valuable insights into how individuals acquire new
knowledge and skills through conditioning, reinforcement, and punishment.

One of the strengths of behaviorism lies in its focus on objectivity and
empirical evidence. By emphasizing observable behavior, behaviorists have
encouraged rigorous experimentation and measurement, enabling the development of
precise theories and interventions. This approach has been particularly
influential in fields such as psychology, education, and behavior management.

Behaviorism has also highlighted the importance of environmental factors in
shaping behavior. It recognizes that individuals' behaviors are influenced by
their interactions with the environment and the consequences of their actions.
This perspective has led to the development of effective behavior modification
techniques, such as operant conditioning, which can be applied in various
contexts to bring about positive behavioral changes.

However, behaviorism has its limitations. Its exclusive emphasis on observable
behaviors has been criticized for neglecting internal mental processes,
subjective experiences, and individual differences. It fails to fully account
for cognitive processes such as perception, memory, and problem-solving, which
are crucial in human learning. Additionally, behaviorism's reliance on external
reinforcement and punishment as primary mechanisms of learning has been
questioned for its limited consideration of intrinsic motivation and the role of
internal rewards.

Despite these limitations, behaviorism remains a valuable framework for
understanding and modifying behavior, particularly in contexts where observable
outcomes are the primary focus. It has paved the way for the development of
subsequent learning theories that incorporate cognitive and socio-cultural
factors, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the learning process.
** TODO Association
From the end of 19th century to the beginning of 20th century, Thorndike’s
learning theory had occupied the leadership in American psychological circles
for nearly 50 years. Thorndike is the pioneer of animal psychology at Harvard
University. Since 1896, he systematically studied animal behaviors by using a
chicken, cat, dog, fish, etc., thus first putting forward the most intact
learning theory in learning psychology. Through the scientific experiment
method, he found that individual learning is via a kind of “try to be successful
accidentally by mistake.” In this way, a kind of connection or combination
between stimulus and response is established through repeated responses to a
stimulus. In Thorndike’s view, the essence of learning lay in forming the
association between situation and response.  So this kind of learning theory is
known as association theory.
