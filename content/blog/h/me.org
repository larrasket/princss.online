Or; An Introduction to the Fragments of Self
#+END_PREVIEW

Around the time that he reached the unnerving milestone of turning thirty, Leonardo da Vinci wrote a letter to the ruler of Milan listing the reasons he should be given a job. He had been moderately successful as a painter in Florence, but he had trouble ﬁnishing his commissions and was searching for new horizons. In the ﬁrst ten paragraphs, he touted his engineering skills, including his ability to design bridges, waterways, cannons, armored vehicles, and public buildings. Only in the eleventh paragraph, at the end, did he add that he was also an artist. {{{hl(“Likewise in painting I can do everything possible” he wrote.)}}}[cite:@isaacson-2017-leonar-vinci]


I don't usually post many stuff about myself online, this page tries to make up for this. I don't like the aspect in general to have a virtual life, this was why I didn't care much to post details about myself online. However, this tended to make people presume things about. I hope that this page will help reducing the severity of unsupported thoughts about me.

* Interests
I'm interested in the following fields: computer programming, cognitive science, linguistics, history, scientific socialism, propaganda and media studies, moral philosophy and +philosophy of mind+, Islamic philosophy, +Islamic biographical evaluation+ and +modern Takhrij studies+. I've developed a growing interest in the following fields: chemistry and economics.

Other interests are implied in my [[id:omy9ejo02wj0][Books]] list.

I consider myself to be an intermediate chess player, my peak rating ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system][Glicko]]) was 1950, my current rating on my only active account is 1808 (after a long strike of losing). For my thoughts on chess, see the post [[id:b8u34341owj0][Thoughts on Chess]].

Generally I think chess is one of the few games that I'd like to play (I think gaming is a great waste of time in general), the game GO seems interesting too.

What I like about this kind of games that it is free of anything but the free will of one's decisions. See more on that on [[id:mp56qej0fzj0][A View on Chess]].
* On the web
I exist in other places on the web. +I'm on Stack Exchange network. Especially: [[https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/69248/][Skeptics SE]] and [[https://islam.stackexchange.com/users/56455/][Islam SE]].+ I also exist on [[https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lr0][HN]] and [[https://lobste.rs/~lr0/stories][Lobsters]]. I don't use social media to connect with people. Even when I do, I do not appreciate people who I don't know in person communicating with me there. 
** If you want to know me
This gets me to another point. Some people think I'm avoidant for new people. I'm not at all, if you find that we share interests, I'd be glad to know more about you. The best way to communicate with me can be found on the footer of the home page.

Projects that I'm considering to get into next.

- +musql+. I'd love a queryable music player that would support generating sets of
  music using a complex tagging system. Let's say that you have a playlist for
  sad songs and another one for you when you feel proud. What if you feel both?
  like a success depression. A possible solution would be creating a new list
  that includes both. However, what if you need a list that contains only the
  sad songs that are not about love? It will be impossible with that linear
  system to do it without manual intervention.

  But if you were able to tag each song as "sad, love", and you had a DSL
  language for querying (let it be even just SQL), such scenario is very
  feasible.

  I've been thinking about this idea for a fairly long time. But I'm horrible at
  designing/implementing UI ends. If you can help, contact me.

  - [2025-03-29 Sat 21:50] Just found out that Apple Music has this feature. I'm
    canceling this project. See more [[id:p4pacx81lik0][The reason that makes Apple's software better]].

- (as of [2024-10-17 Thu 18:15], I'm no longer interested in this)  [[https://sr.ht/~lr0/cblocks/][cblocks]]. I started
  this project as an exercise for my C fluency and because I needed an alternative for the
  dwm bar I'm using, with more flexibility. This project was successful (it reads a
  compiled C module, load, evaluate it and update the status bar with the evaluated
  string), however, I wanted to add concurrency which is an essential feature for me.
  Sadly I totally forgot how hard was it to work with concurrency in C. I think I might
  rewrite it in Go, but I'm not sure who to implement the dynamism in Go.

* Occupation                                                          :noexport:
I work as a Software Engineer in FinTech.

+I'm not currently certain about listing my profession, despite it being self-explanatory from many posts here and my general online activity, however, I do not like to be defined by it at all, and any other professions in which I may get involved forthcoming.+

+This to imply to you my view of what is 'professional', if I ever had the opportunity of being financially independent I'd definitely be. I'm not the kind of "I love my job" people[fn:1], however, I do love my job, but it's a love that means to an end: not to starve to death[fn:8]. (although as of [2025-02-09 Sun 21:57] I acknowledge that I got the opportunity to work with a set of a very smart people that I enjoy being surrounded by and having them as a company. I might need to write about this era of my life someday)+

+This is also to say that I don't like spending my time out of work doing, thinking, reading, discussing, or —God forbid— studying anything that is related to my profession. I've many other [[Interests][Interests]] to spend my time on rather than whatever I do to make money.+
* TODO Religion                                                       :@write:
I'm Muslim. I disagree with the mainstream definition of Islamic faith, this includes my views of the early history of Islam, caliphate and Shiism. I plan to write about that soon on this website.
* Languages
I speak Arabic and English. As my course of learning linguistics, I'm learning
another language, it's supposed to be German (as of [2024-02-29 Thu 01:05]) but
I'm considering moving to French. - [2025-05-07 Wed 04:02] Update: my language
course was paused due to other projects and interests.
* My favorite animals
#+begin_quote
واعلم أن الحيوان هو آية الكون وسِحره؛ وإنّما أنتَ استثناء.
— عباس ابراهام.
#+end_quote
I like to read and study animal behavior. We humans have many intersection
points with them, you can notice that while contemplating other mammals
behavior.  [[id:5yu8gy0083k0][Desmond Morris]] was the first one to get me interested in reading
about animal behavior, after I finished his magnum opus (the naked ape) I was
looking for more by the same author. I like these animals because I admire some
of their manners: [[file:../i/2024-01-26_21-34-41_screenshot.png][Hare]], [[file:../i/2024-01-26_21-35-00_screenshot.png][Python]], [[file:../i/2024-01-26_21-35-12_screenshot.png][Jugar]] and [[file:../i/2024-01-26_21-35-28_screenshot.png][Greyish eagle-owl]]. I never owned a pet.
* Some random preferences
Olive is my favorite food, most of my favorite recipes contain olive. There is no -generally speaking- any kind of food that I would refuse to eat, however I do refuse to consume any food that contains any form of artificial sweeteners (raw sugar, refined white sugar, etc..). My favorite drink is tea. I do consume lemonade regularly too. My consumption of coffee is high as well, however I do not really prefer it and I only drink it for my need of caffeine. If I can find someday a caffeine substitute (that is comparable to ground coffee) I will quit coffee.

I drink only ground coffee. I try to avoid manufactured instant coffee for health concerns (also most instance coffee products do not have approximate amount of caffeine that ground coffee posses). I don't like coffee with milk.

[[https://youtu.be/F9dBl_pLc3g][TSU! - Prince of Gumbay]] For me, this is the most peaceful piece of music I've
ever heard.

I do not use Spotify or any other music proprietary platforms. I download and stream music
offline on my computer machine. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmus][cmus]] is my music player. See [[Planned][Planned]] for my plans for
building a music player.

Currently, I'm not interested in exploring any new types of music, I prefer to stick to
the collection I already have.
** Leonard Cohen

There’s truth that lives \\

So nevermind \\
#+end_quote
My first time of experiencing Cohen's music was from opening one of my colleagues Spotify
accounts, I was in high school back then, when I listened to the music, which was Sing
Another Song, Boys, the seventh song from Songs Of Love And Hate (my ever favorite album
of his by now), I didn't like it initially, but I felt that it was very different from
anything I've ever listened to (and I still believe that it's indeed a unique work of
music).

I remember that I spent days listening to it, I was back then possessing some interest in
pursuing a biotechnology degree and I was studying a biochemistry textbook; I still get
some intrusive chemical formulas into my head every time I play the song, because I used
to study that book while listening to it on repeat, though I do not mind it at all.

I didn't play any other songs by him since that, so I can say that the real time
for me to learn about Cohen was from the movie [[https://youtu.be/TXwCCWHl5Ak][Exotica (1994)]], since then I fell
in love with his songwritings, following are my favorite works from him (not sorted):

- Songs Of Love And Hate - 7. Sing Another Song, Boys
- Leonard Cohen - Thanks for the Dance - 6. The Goal
- Thanks for the Dance - 1. Happens to the Heart
- You Want It Darker - 7. It Seemed the Better Way
- Cohen Live - 9. Who By Fire? - Live in Austin, 1988
- Live In Dublin - 8. Amen - Live in Dublin
- Various Positions - 6. The Captain
- Death Of A Ladies' Man - 1. True Love Leaves No Traces
- Songs Of Leonard Cohen - 9. Teachers
- I'm Your Man - 3. Everybody Knows
- Ten New Songs - 4. Here It Is
- Recent Songs - 2. Humbled in Love
- Recent Songs - 10. Ballad of the Absent Mare - Longer Version
- Songs Of Love And Hate - 1. Avalanche

I'm easily stirred by music that brings nostalgic melody. I don't dislike it, but it
extremely affects my mood[fn:3]. Thus I tend to avoid having or listening to any of this
genre.  Some songs that gives me this kind of vibes are:[fn:5]
- Ya Waadi Aal Ayame, Ahmed Mounib[fn:2]
- Dayret El Rehla, Ahmed Mounib
- Eh fi amal, Fayrouz
- Bageelek, Hamid El Shaeri

- Nesmet Saba, Hamid el-Shaeri
- Long Long Time Ago, Javier Navarrete

This piece is a one of my very few specials. I remember learning about it for the first time
from the movie V for Vendetta (2005), which is one of my ever favorites, but I didn't pay
much attention back then, and I think I only learnt about it by the 2022 Russian invasion
of Ukraine. It affects me very much, and it gives me vibes from [[https://youtu.be/p3pfJukO5QU][Shadows of Forgotten
Ancestors (Sergei Parajanov, 1965)]]. I only listen to / play both in special occasions, due
to their great effect on me.

[2024-01-11 Thu 01:43] I'm not the kind of person who would get upset easily, I
do not really mind people doing anything I do not like unless it is critical to
the core of whatever process we are operating (let it be work or discussion).
The stuff blew only applies if you are trying to be so nice to me, which I will
appreciate, not the stuff I want others necessarily to follow.

- I do not like being praised. I usually fail to respond to sentences of the kind "you
  are smart" and the like.
  #+begin_quote
Here is some one who, you perceive, wishes to praise
you: you bite your lips and brace up your heart: Oh, that that
cup might go hence! But it does not, it comes! let us therefore
drink the sweet impudence of the panegyrist, let us overcome
the disgust and profound contempt that we feel for the innermost
substance of his praise, let us assume a look of thankful joy—for
he wished to make himself agreeable to us! And now that it
is all over we know that he feels greatly exalted; he has been
victorious over us. Yes, and also over himself, the villain!—for
it was no easy matter for him to wring this praise from himself.

    #+begin_quote
Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and terminates
in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither worse then nor better is
a thing made by being praised. I affirm this also of the things which are called
beautiful by the vulgar, for example, material things and works of art. That
which is really beautiful has no need of anything; not more than law, not more
than truth, not more than benevolence or modesty. Which of these things is
beautiful because it is praised, or spoiled by being blamed? Is such a thing as
an emerald made worse than it was, if it is not praised? or gold, ivory, purple,
a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub?
