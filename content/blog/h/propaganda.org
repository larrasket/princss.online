#+title: Propaganda
#+filetags: :project:


#+CAPTION: Propaganda, an insidious force that permeates the fabric of society, weaves a web of distorted truths and manipulative narratives. It is the art of persuasion wielded as a weapon, exploiting the vulnerabilities of the human mind to mold opinions, stifle dissent, and shape collective consciousness. Like a venomous serpent, propaganda slithers through the shadows, distorting reality and subverting the very essence of truth.

The propaganda machine ruthlessly indoctrinates, manipulating emotions and appealing to primal instincts, all while camouflaging its ulterior motives behind a veneer of righteousness.

#+begin_quote
This is an oversimplification, but for the eighty per cent [of the population]
or whatever they are, the main thing is to divert them. To get them to watch
National Football League. And to worry about ‘Mother with Child with Six Heads,’
or whatever you pick up on the supermarket stands and so on. Or look at
astrology. Or get involved in fundamentalist stuff or something or other. Just
get them away. Get them away from things that matter. And for that it’s
important to reduce their capacity to think.

  works without theorizing anything, he was not trying to extract a model from the events

A lecture by [[id:5a780a66-e9ff-4712-8269-3d1cd1556c95][Noam Chomsky]] on media policies. Available as text:
https://chomsky.info/19890315/.


Chomsky says that the following views have developed in different shapes:

#+begin_quote
Now in the last- in the modern period you get a much more sophisticated development of
these ideas. So, for example, Reinhold Niebuhr, who is a much-respected moralist and
commentator on world affairs, he wrote that rationality belongs to the cool observers, but
because of the stupidity of the average man, he follows not reason but faith. And this
na•ve faith requires that necessary illusions be developed. Emotionally potent
oversimplifications have to be provided by the myth-makers to keep the ordinary person on
course, because of the stupidity of the average man. That’s the same view, basically.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Walter Lippman, who was the dean of American journalists, is the man who invented the
phrase manufacture of consent. He described the manufacture of consent as a self-conscious
art and a regular organ of popular government. This, he said, is quite important, this is
a revolution in the practice of democracy, and he thought it was a worthwhile revolution.
The reason is, again, the stupidity of the average man. The common interests, he said,
very largely elude public opinion entirely, and they can be managed only by a specialized
class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality. That’s Niebuhr’s cool observers.
You can guess who’s part of them. The person who pronounces these views is always part of
that group. It’s the others who aren’t. This is in Walter Lippman’s book Public Opinion,
which appeared shortly after World War I. And the timing is important.

From [[id:0xsj21517ak0][Noam Chomsky - 1989-03-15 - Manufacturing Consent]].

This contrary view can be traced back to the origins of modern democracy in the 17th
century English revolution, when, for the first time, the- there was a challenge to the
right of authority — whether it was the gentry, or the king, or whatever — and there was
actually the beginnings of a real, radical, democratic movement, with a commitment on the
part of the people involved, who were very widespread in England, to public involvement
and control over affairs. They didn’t want to be ruled by the king, and they didn’t want
to be ruled by parliament, they wanted to run their own affairs. And they were defeated,
the radical democrats were defeated, but not before doing some important things which had
a lasting effect.

Well, what I’m interested in now is the reaction to this. The reaction to the first
efforts at popular democracy — radical democracy, you might call it — were a good deal of
fear and concern. One historian of the time, Clement Walker, warned that these guys who
were running- putting out pamphlets on their little printing presses, and distributing
them, and agitating in the army, and, you know, telling people how the system really
worked, were having an extremely dangerous effect. They were revealing the mysteries of
government. And he said that’s dangerous, because it will, I’m quoting him, /it will make
people so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a
civil rule/. And that’s a problem.

John Locke, a couple of years later, explained what the problem was. He said, day-laborers
and tradesmen, the spinsters and the dairy-maids, must be told what to believe; the
greater part cannot know, and therefore they must believe. And of course, someone must
tell them what to believe.

If you go back to the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences published in 1933 —
days when people were a little more open and honest in what they said — there’s an article
on propaganda, and it’s well worth reading. There’s an entry under propaganda. The entry
is written by a leading- one- maybe the leading American political scientist, Harold
Lasswell, who was very influential, particularly in this area, communications, and so on.
And in this entry in the International Encyclopedia on propaganda he says, we should not
succumb to democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests.
They’re not, he said. Even with the rise of mass education- doesn’t mean that people can
judge their own interests. They can’t. The best judges of their interests are elites — the
specialized class, the cool observers, the people who have rationality — and therefore
they must be granted the means to impose their will. Notice, for the common good. Because,
again, because- well, he says, because of the ignorance and superstition of the masses, he
said it’s necessary to have a whole new technique of control, largely through propaganda.
Propaganda, he says, we shouldn’t have a negative connotation about, it’s neutral.
Propaganda, he says, is as neutral as a pump handle. You can use it for good, you can use
it for bad; since were good people, obviously, — that’s sort of true by definition — we’ll
use it for good purposes, and there should be no negative connotations about that. In
fact, it’s moral to use it, because that’s the only way that you can save the ignorant and
stupid masses of the population from their own errors. You don’t let a three year old run
across the street, and you don’t let ordinary people make their own decisions. You have to
control them.


And why do you need propaganda? Well, he explains that. He says, in military-run or feudal
societies — what we would these days call totalitarian societies — you don’t really need
propaganda that much. And the reason is you’ve got a- you’ve got a club in your hand. You
can control the way people behave, and therefore it doesn’t matter much what they think,
because if they get out of line you can control them — for their own good, of course. But
once you lose the club, you know, once the State loses its capacity to coerce by force,
then you have some problems. The voice of the people is heard — you’ve got all these
formal mechanisms around that permit people to express themselves, and even participate,
and vote, and that sort of thing — and you can’t control them by force, because you’ve
lost that capacity. But the voice of the people is heard, and therefore you’ve got to make
sure it says the right thing. And in order to make sure it says the right thing, you’ve
got to have effective and sophisticated propaganda, again, for their own good.

The- a presidential- well-known historian, presidential historian, Thomas Baily, explained
in 1948, that because the masses are notoriously short-sighted, and generally cannot see
danger until it is at their throats, our statesmen are forced to deceive them into an
awareness of their own long-run interests. Deception of the people may, in fact, become
increasingly necessary, unless we are willing to give our leaders in Washington a freer
hand.


In other words, if we continue this nonsense of trying to control them through elections,
and that sort of thing, it’s going to be necessary to have deception of the people,
because the masses are too stupid and ignorant to understand the danger that’s at their
throat. And that’s the role of the media, to carry out the appropriate deception.

The Vietnam- the 60s created what liberal elites called a crisis of democracy. That’s the
title of a quite important book on all of these topics, the first, and in fact, only
book-length publication of the Trilateral Commission, published in 1975, called The Crisis
of Democracy. It’s about the problem of governability of democracies. And there was a
problem of the governability of democracies because people were getting out of hand. The
domestic enemy was getting out of control, and something had to be done about it.

The Trilateral Commission puts together liberal corporate/State elites from the three
major centers of State capitalism — Western Europe, the United States, and Japan, that’s
why the trilateral. And it is the liberal elites. This is the group around Jimmy Carter.
That’s where he came from, in fact, and virtually all of his cabinet and top advisers.
It’s that segment of opinion.

The American rapporteur, the guy who gave the report on the- for the United States, was,
again, Samuel Huntington. And he pointed out that Truman had been able to govern the
country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and
bankers. Then there was no crisis of democracy. That’s the way things are supposed to be.

Incidentally, this kind of vulgar Marxist rhetoric is not untypical of internal documents
in the government, or in the business press, and so on, and this was intended to be an
internal document; they didn’t really expect people to read it, but it’s worth reading.
I’m sure the library has it. They should.

Well, that’s a view that goes right back to the origins of the republic. If you read the
sayings of the founding fathers, you will discover that that was essentially their view as
well. They also regarded the public as a dangerous threat. The way the country ought to be
organized, as John Jay put it, the president of the constitutional convention and the
first supreme court- chief justice of the supreme court, his- one of his favorite maxims,
according to his biographer, was that those who run- those who own the country ought to
govern it. And if they can’t govern it by force, they’ve got to govern it in another way,
and that ultimately requires deception, propaganda, indoctrination, the manufacture of
consent.

Psychological operations (PSYOP) are operations to convey selected information and
indicators to audiences to influence their motives and objective reasoning, and ultimately
the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and large foreign powers.

The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or reinforce behavior
perceived to be favorable to U.S. objectives.

Very interesting propaganda example.. not sure how can I work someday on
improving the general awareness.

It was a Louay Alkhatib post, seems like I forgot to include it.

Are you interested in reading about the propaganda model? Following related
literature is recommended, however, I recommend starting with a small modern
paper: [cite:@Robinson2015]. It examines each filter proposed in the propaganda
model assessing its relevancy and giving modern examples.

- [[id:889d78a9-8707-407b-9be4-e508c45033c3][Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]] (Chomsky et al.)
  [fn:: (NOTE: for a readable PDF version, see [[id:acx9s711gzj0][Better PDF version of
  Manufacuring Consent]]) While it's one of my favorite works ever, I do not
  think that it was best-written. The book is full with examples for propaganda
  promoted mainly by the US-based media (of course the book gave a reasoning for
  that, that's the [[id:c2whd5819zj0][US provides highly accessible information]] systems if compared
  to any other place) instead of forming and answering questions related to the
  propaganda model. It's still highly recommended book for people who are new to
  the real uncovered US politics against enemy states. For further investigation
  about propaganda models, [cite:@pedro-caranana-2018-propag] is recommended
  instead.]
- Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda (Chomsky, N.)[fn::
  This is an oversimplified Manufacturing Consent, however the latter is about
  to be an out-of-date model, see [cite:@pedro-caranana-2018-propag]]
- [[id:8vykhwd0sxj0][The Propaganda Model Today]] (Broudy et al.)
- [[id:4n7cwpf061k0][The Propaganda Model: Still Relevant Today?]] (Robinson, P.)
