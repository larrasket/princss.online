I had the first I met with Tony Marston <https://www.tonymarston.net> on the Internet was on Dec 2024, when I read his 2018 "Why I don't do Domain Driven Design", I found it a bit strange post, but in a good way (what I believed back then), I thought it's an enjoyable discussion, so I post it on Hacker News and it was discussed a bit [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539477][there]]. I never met with Marston again, but I learnt that he had some radical, sometimes ridiculous, views. But how doesn't, right? Couple of days ago there was a discussion on GitHub about Object-Oriented Programming, I was not investing a lot of effort there pointing out my views, because it was obvious to me that the opponents are not distinguishing between "encourages", "allows", and "emphasize" bad practices[fn:8]. Someone replied to my comment there, I didn't pay a lot of attention once they mentioned that inheritance and encapsulation magnified their productivity. "you lost me after "inheritance". It sounds like you have no idea of how bad code looks like" [[https://github.com/gentlee/gentlee.github.io/discussions/4#discussioncomment-15183074][I wrote]]. I got a very strange response from their side, projecting, and just bizarre. "If my code is THAT bad, then why has it won numerous awards? If you think YOUR code is better than mine then take this challenge to prove it."[fn:9], the bottom line was "Note that in all cases I was using a development framework that I had designed and built myself. How many frameworks have you written?". I was just speechless at this moment when I read the email. I couldn't response, when I browsed some of the website, I realized this was Tony from the DDD article, but the rest of the website and content was not pretty at all, it felt like I went into a limited intelligence 70 years old elder who was a lot into programming. I've shown the commend to some of my friends who couldn't take it seriously at all, especially the "how many frameworks", one [[https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/1pgl5n3/note_that_in_all_cases_i_was_using_a_development/][posted]] it on r/programmingcirclejerk. The people there had more tolerance than me to look at Marston's world, and some made deeper investigations: "Let me explain something. There's a guy who writes code. He claims he can create in PHP in 5 minutes what would take 5 days to create using COBOL. He creates a product. He gets a letter saying his product has been nominated. The organization that gives out the prizes has a Twitter account without any announcements and a simple website that clearly states that participation is free. But to get the award and beautiful photos - you have to pay. Oh, and you won't find a list of nominees or a list of who received their award on their website. This guy writes that his anon fans nominated him, but I wouldn't be surprised if this organization itself creates spam mailings. I think it's even a little sad. Stupidity and self-confidence are a terrible combination. This guy seems to be losing touch with reality. Sad...", I opened Marston's [[https://old.reddit.com/user/TonyMarston][reddit profile]], first glance was -100 karma, I know reddit its awful but really how bad you need to be to get to -100? I found that the guy is just ragebaiting[fn:10] the whole PHP community, getting [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/yx0cte/comment/iyp3zfz/][roasted]] over and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/111f0r4/i_hate_deprecation_of_passing_null_to_nonnullable/][over]] and [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/z5ap2a/an_overview_of_the_architecture_on_which_the/][over]]. Some dude wrote on a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/yx0cte/how_to_create_a_family_of_forms_to_maintain_the/iwmmoe0/][comment]] "You just HAVE to look up this guy's website and previous discussions both here and on Sitepoint. You'll be entertained for hours.", although of all this continuous criticism and even bullying of the guy, he is so [[https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/core-developers-are-idiots.html][rude]] and [[https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/please-do-not-break-our-language.html][arrogant]], let alone stupid. I just feel sad for this, what it takes for someone to be like this? "When I read this, I imagined how David Lynch (RIP) would film it: a developer tries to start working but IDE is not installed on his computer. The developer takes a desperate step and tries to download and install IDE himself, but it turns out that IDE is already installed, it's just that its shortcut is not on the desktop. As if everything is not so bad, but the next moment he launches Vi... Panic, the clock on the wall starts ticking loudly. The developer calls his colleagues and asks for help but hears loud laughter in response..." ‒ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/1pgl5n3/comment/nsuh46b/][BenchEmbarrassed7316]].

I wrote about exception handling before in my draft on programming languages, generally, I consider exception handling to be extremely distasteful, and before you relate this to me being biased toward functional states, no I had this feeling from the first day writing C#; I was always astonished by how the MS documentation was strictly telling us "hey be careful with this thing" and hopping for the best, and for the way my app needed a "global exception handler" that swallows everything, and I looked and looked for a way in which I could just know whether a function throw or not, I assumed that I'm getting something wrong, because I couldn't believe that this is a standard practice and due to my insufficient experience back then, I couldn't find any literature discussing this problem. I wrote about a similar concern in my old mentioned draft, but it's far from complete in the regard of why throwing exceptions is generally a terrible idea. Here I'm sharing some of contributions that I found: 1. [[https://www.lighterra.com/papers/exceptionsharmful/][Exception Handling Considered Harmful]][fn:6] 2. [[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/13/13/][13 – Joel on Software]] 3. [[https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/exceptions-considered-harmful/][Exceptions Considered Harmful]] 4. [[https://dave.cheney.net/2012/01/18/why-go-gets-exceptions-right][Why Go gets exceptions right | Dave Cheney]]. From the other side: 1. [[https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2017/02/19/youre-better-off-using-exceptions/][You’re better off using Exceptions – Eirik Tsarpalis' blog]] and I have a quick response for some issues it demonstrates; a. An Awkward Reconciliation: this assumes that the programming language you are using, library or other called functions are going to throw, which is invalid if you can never have this state in your language. b. Boilerplate: this is a style preference IMO, most of Go developers for example do not mind the infamous ~if err != nil~ for me it's explicit and eloquent. c. Where’s my Stacktrace?: exporting the Stacktrace has nothing to do with throwing exceptions, it's very possible to expose it in almost all languages (including Go) without exceptions. 2.

Reading [cite:@hall-2023-beejs-guide]. It has an interesting note for Windows
programmers: "At this point in the guide, historically, I’ve done a bit of
bagging on Windows, simply due to the fact that I don’t like it very much. But
then Windows and Microsoft (as a company) got a lot better. Windows 10 coupled
with WSL (below) actually makes for a decent operating system. Not really a lot
to complain about.  Well, a little—for example, I’m writing this (in 2025) on a
2015 laptop that used to run Windows 10. Eventually it got too slow and I
installed Linux on it. And have been using it ever since.  But now we have
Windows 11 that apparently requires beefier hardware than Windows 10. I’m not a
fan of that. The OS should be as unobtrusive as possible and not require you to
spend more money.  The extra CPU power should be for apps, not the OS!
Additionally, Microsoft knows what you want, and what you want is more
advertising! Right? In your operating system! Weren’t you missing that? Now you
can have it with Windows 11.  So… I still encourage you to try Linux , BSD ,
illumos or any other flavor of Unix instead of Windows.". It's a nice harsh
punch for newcomers. I still think that MS Windows is one of the worst blocking
obstacles in 21th computing. Perhaps one big factor that made mobile usage
thrive they way it is, was the way MS made the desktop experience so bad, and
the way Apple made it unaffordable.

These might sound extremely unrelated topics, and yes they are. Around 4 or 5
years ago I used to watch a YouTuber who started his channel with the pandamic,
and I was learning some C# patterns then. He was making these nice videos about
C#, and his way of explaining some topics was really fun. However, he started
also giving some dating advices[fn:5], I stopped following him when he started
doing all that dating stuff, but later he made a single one video on Ukraine
war, it was about the tanks. The video went so popular and since then his
channel got around 500K followers, I don't recall him making any videos again on
tech or dating and I'm unsure if he even kept them. The reason why I'm talking
about him (and sorry if it will disappoint you), is that he keeps popping into
my mind every once and a while, and I totally forgot about him and his name, and
the story sounds very unfamiliar that if I tell anyone about it they might not
believe me. So I'm putting this here, if you know what I'm talking about, even
if you're reading this 5 years later, let me know that I'm not the only person
who remembers that strange phenomena.

I had a discussion with the MPV developers regarding the software state on
MacOS (it was held on IRC), typically I was against MPV enabling "gaming mode"
to perform better, it's a very unarthodox action that no player else does, and
very annoying because, obviously, it is not a game, moreover it costs a lot of
unnecessary allocation and energy. Today I noticed how horrible the
auto-resizing feature is when you are having multiple monitors set together.

I've done some digital privacy violation acts throughout different periods, that
I'm not very proud of. Some of them involved some people with whom I shared
personal trust. Last year in 22 Jul, I discussed them with a close friend and we
made a journal for all of them. I realized then how most of these incidents
(almost all of them, the exception goes for a single one) I was not the one to
behold liable of the violation, rather, it's usually another entity that he or
she had shared the information with (usually inadvertently) which I dealt with
(for example botnet-as-a-service providers and RAT markets). Obv, وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي,
I am guilty for doing it in the first place, but what I'm pointing out here is
that most people who are getting digitally violated (that, basically, most of
tech illiterates out there) chosen not to care much about being violated by
someone at the first place, it only mattered to them when that shared
information was delivered to someone relevant, i.e. to me.

Following is a good note on anger, mentioned in
[cite:@al-muqaffaa-2019-al-durrah-yateem]: اعلم أن من الناس ناسًا كثيرًا يبلغ من
أحدهم الغضبُ — إذا غضب — أن يحمله ذلك على الكلوح والتقطيب في وجه غير من أغضبه،
وسوء اللفظ لمن لا ذنب له، والعقوبة لمن لم يكن يهم بعقوبته، وسوء المعاقبة باليد
واللسان لمن لم يكن يريد به إلا دون ذلك، ثم يبلغ به الرضى — إذا رضي — أن يتبرَّع
بالأمر ذي الخطر لمن ليس بمنزلة ذلك عنده، ويعطي من لم يكن أعطاه، ويكرم من لا حق
له ولا مودَّة. فاحذرْ هذا الباب كلَّه، فإنه ليس أحدٌ أسوأَ حالًا من أهل القدرة الذين
يُفرِّطون باقتدارهم في غضبهم وسرعة رضاهم، فإنه لو وصف بهذه الصفة من يلتبس بعقله أو
يتخبَّطه المسُّ أن يُعاقِب في غضبه غيرَ من أغضبه، ويحبو عند رضاه غيرَ من أرضاه، لكان
جائزًا في صفته.

I had a terrible experience trying to self-host Supabase today. I have read on
the community posts that the experience is usually not very pleasant, however, I
found official maintainers responding to that saying that it was improved, with
a video showing it running on a 2GB of RAM and 2vCPUs droplet. I had various
problems with getting the docker-compose to work; apparently you can not really
change the default passwords without running into an authentication issue (see
[[https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/11957][here]] for example), and even if you fixed that you will go through couple of
[[https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/2737][analytics]] issues. My biggest concern, however, was that I was never able to get
anything to run on the very small droplet that the maintainer showed off, in
fact, the only specifications that could provide the bare minimum performance
(that is: the dashboard is loading) was 8GB of RAM, and two dedicated CPUs (yes,
dedicated, not vCPUs), however, even with that a lot of problems persisted (many
features are not working, and it is a hell to try to authenticate the CLI with
that setup). I wonder if their development team is choosing deliberately not to
make the self-host experience better to enforce people to use their cloud
services instead of selfhosting it. I really do not get the point of having such
a software to be open-source if it won't be easy to self-host.

TIL that Robert W. Floyd is not the real author of Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm: The algorithm is named after Robert W. Floyd, who was credited with its invention by Donald Knuth. However, the algorithm does not appear in Floyd's published work, and this may be a misattribution: Floyd describes algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a directed graph in a 1967 paper, but this paper does not describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs that is the subject of this article. In fact, Knuth's statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in print, and it thus may be a folk theorem, not attributable to a single individual. I wonder if anyone asked Donald Knuth about that in an interview.

Here's a good video from TikTok about setting boundaries in kinds of
friendships: https://www.tiktok.com/@the3rdside/video/7479090078267231534. I
find myself trying to explain this kind of boundaries people from time to time.

  I made the archive for 2024. Moreover, I changed the archive from containing only every 3 months (I stole this from rms), to be of all the year.
- [2025-06-28 Sat 20:04] 2024-2025 was a heavy time. I will probably organize it
  in the archive after I get over it.

* (outdated) How does this page work
- [2025-11-29 Sat 00:40] \\
  As of now this is very outdated, this blog runs from a highly sophisticated (yes I'm calling it that) Elisp system.
[2022-09-23 Fri 20:15]: If you are an old reader (if such a thing exists) of this blog, you should know by now about my many old attempts of creating a stack-based posting that works within my editing environment (Emacs) which has always failed. I'm very good at Elisp, suck at writing Elisp packages \*Sigh\* life doesn't give you everything. Anyway I thought that everything I need to implement such a workflow, is only a program that appends an entity top of a string, and I started to implement it as a separated program in Go. However, while doing it I recognized that ~(org-caputre)~ already does it, just needed a simple custom configuration:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq +org-capture-journal-file "~/blog/content/stack.org")
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("j" "Journal" entry
           (file+headline +org-capture-journal-file "Posts")
           "* %<%A, %d %B %Y>\n%?"  :prepend t)))
#+end_src

I also found a predefined way of doing it that build a full hierarchy date for
the entity, but I decided to go simple this time.

*Cons;*

+ I've to archive it myself, no pagination.
+ [2022-10-05 Wed 20:18]: I figured out a workaround to archive, and I don't
  think I really need tags. Everything works great.
+ [2024-02-15 Thu 20:19]: I do not find this workflow very good as of now, I do
  not think that archiving is necessary either. I wil try to think of something
  else soon.

* Footnotes
[fn:10]Or not really, you need to know what you are saying is rubbish to be "ragebaiting" 

[fn:9] The attached "challenge" leads nowhere, you can find the working link easily though. 
[fn:8] That is, if you will accept a tool for what it is, regardless of what it allows you to do with it, and how likely it is to be misused, you are doing a very bad job from an engineering perspective.  

[fn:7]Skipping commenting in this one, since the former source implicitly included all of its claims.
[fn:6] I enjoyed that post a lot, and Patterson seems to be very thoughtful and thorough author, it's sad that he is not oftenly writing anymore. I'm planning to go through the old posts that are still on that website.

[fn:5] which was hilarious, because he looked like
someone who would really make use of some


[fn:2]Not exported to the blog. Might be exported later.

[fn:1] Some are born posthumously
