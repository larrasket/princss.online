- [2025-08-08 Fri 01:16] Disabling this page again. Sorry if you were redirected from an art-related link, but that's just too messy to host on my small website. If I ever have the time, I will work on making it exportable.
- [2025-07-21 Mon 23:25] You can also click on an image to open it in a new tab. This can be helpful if the lazyloader makes the image appear in a late stage (so you will see a gray loader instead of it). The page size is big because it loads a lot of images. I got this feedback from IRC, but the whole purpose of this page, as mentioned before, is only for personal reference.
- [2025-07-19 Sat 21:16] Sometimes I find myself continually questioning the fundamental purpose of art and beauty. That tension becomes especially pronounced when I consider how the same aesthetic principles that govern a Bach fugue or a neoclassical building also manifest in engineering: the graceful curve of a suspension bridge's cables, the elegant logic of a well-designed algorithm, or the satisfying economy of a mechanical solution that achieves maximum effect with minimal means. Paul Graham's observations in "Hackers and Painters" about the fundamental similarity between engineering and painting suggest that perhaps what we call beauty is actually our recognition of deeper structural harmonies—patterns that reveal themselves whether we're contemplating the mathematical relationships in a Mozart sonata, the load distribution in a cathedral's flying buttresses, or the recursive elegance of a piece of code that solves a complex problem with startling simplicity. This leads me to wonder whether aesthetic experience represents not mere decoration or distraction from reality, but rather our most direct method of perceiving the underlying order that governs natural and human-made systems alike. Maybe that's a TODO to discuss in a post later. Or a wondering thought that will die with me.
- [2025-07-17 Thu 20:59] I updated the page to include lazy-loading and collapsed all the headings by default, you will have to click them to get them folded. This will require JS to run (for some reason, lazy-loading is not working properly on some mobile phones)
- [2025-07-16 Wed 05:59]: Some artist are only partially included here, because I absolutely adore every work of them, and I find it unnecessary to include each. As of now, these are:
  - Thomas Cole
- [2025-05-09 Fri 04:59] This part is currently available. It used to be marked as a private note. I'm making it available now just for the case of the references I might use in my blog. I plan some day to turn this page into a more pleasant-to-browse website.
- [2024-02-17 Sat 23:47] I'm a bit confused of how to write my notes on the images, including the artist metadata and my points, in an unstructured data format (plaintext) but still, make it easy for me when the day comes and I want to process this data. Maybe I just should go intuitively?
- [2024-02-17 Sat 23:30] I've been thinking of building a PKMS-like software but for managing my art collections. By now, I'm considering just maintaining them on this node. Thus, here you can find my favorite paintings and my notes on them.

It's sad that Fromentin's writings are not accessible, I'm sure his life had
many interesting spots and stories to tell about.

I first saw this painting before learning about Fromentin background so I
thoguht it's about Abraham's Journey to Canaan or something related. The way the
man on the white horse is clothed might be the reason.

For some resaon I find this painting very interesting, but I can not explain it.
I read that "the child represents our natural inclination towards the raw beauty
and simplicity of the natural world." and "female figure and her classical
setting symbolize the pursuit of knowledge, refinement, and the ideals of
civilization" but I do not quite get those explanations. I think it's just a
beautiful piece of art.

[[id:270apg8014k0][Eugene Fromentin]] was an author and painter, I read about his sad substory with
his childhood friend who went with other man and rejected his proposal. He went
to Algeria and fell in love with Algerian Sahara. I've many [[id:3904ii8014k0][orientalism]] comments
on this painting, but what attracts me most is the beautiful blue sky.  I've
seen real beautiful night skies in my life, so to be fair, this is not really
beautiful one, however, comparing it to our night sky nowadays, it's really
beautiful.

The increased use of light-emitting diodes causes our night sky to undergo a 10%
decrease annually. People would be surprised when you tell them that skies in
works like Sterrennacht were not a matter of intellectual view but in fact skies
used to look like that casually. Today you would have to go very near in the
desert to get such a look, and even that is not comparable to how it used to be.
(talking about this remind me of [[https://youtu.be/QDRZq1yLhpk][this great episode]] that I watched as a kid,
"Boys, you're going to remember this for the rest of your lives").

The painting *O Mistress Mine, Where Are You Roaming?* by Edwin Austin Abbey is
inspired by Shakespeare’s *Twelfth Night*, and it captures a *romantic or
dramatic interaction* between the two central figures.

- The man in **red robes** (possibly a nobleman or a clergyman) leans toward the
  **woman in black and green**, gripping her hand. His posture suggests
  **urgency, persuasion, or pleading**.
- The woman looks **surprised or conflicted**, as if caught between **listening
  to him and resisting his advances**. Her facial expression and hand placement
  suggest hesitation.

- The figure in the background, partly hidden and playing a lute, likely
  represents *a musician or a minstrel*.
- Given the painting’s literary inspiration, she could be connected to *Feste,
  the fool from *Twelfth Night*, who sings the poem from which the painting
  takes its name.
- Her presence suggests that *music is part of the moment*, possibly
  emphasizing the mood of seduction, longing, or sorrow.

- The setting, with *whitewashed walls, bare trees, and cobblestone ground*,
  feels *isolated and intimate*, suggesting *a clandestine meeting*.
- The nobleman's expression and posture indicate an urgent conversation*
  —perhaps a secret romance, a plea for love, or even an attempt
  to persuade her into a forbidden affair.
- The woman’s reserved stance implies indecision—she might be resisting
  temptation, conflicted between duty and desire.

The subject of the painting is the love story of Hellelil, who fell in love with
her bodyguard Hildebrand. When her father hears of it, he sends her seven
brothers to kill Hildebrand. The painting depicts the moment before Hildebrand
goes out to meet the brothers, kissing Hellelil one last time, and parting with
the injuction to "say never my name". Hildebrand subdues each brother until he
comes to the youngest; than Hellelil, forgetting his request, calls to him to
plead for mercy; as Hildebrand complies, the youngest brother kills him. Said
brother takes Hellelil back to their house by dragging her from his horse,
tortures her, and locks her up in a tower for many days, eventually selling her
for a church bell.

  that William Bouguereau won a prize for a figure painting in the École des

Christian art is sacred art which uses subjects, themes, and imagery from [[id:6lkfjxc0nik0][Christianity]]. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, including early Christian art and architecture and Christian media.
** Coronation of the Virgin
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       hz1lah11tik0
:CUSTOM_ID: hz1lah11tik0
:END:
The Coronation of the Virgin or Coronation of Mary is a subject in Christian art, especially popular in Italy in the 13th to 15th centuries, but continuing in popularity until the 18th century and beyond. Christ, sometimes accompanied by God the Father and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, places a crown on the head of Mary as Queen of Heaven. In early versions the setting is a Heaven imagined as an earthly court, staffed by saints and angels; in later versions Heaven is more often seen as in the sky, with the figures seated on clouds. The subject is also notable as one where the whole Christian Trinity is often shown together, sometimes in unusual ways. Crowned Virgins are also seen in Eastern Orthodox Christian icons, specifically in the Russian Orthodox church after the 18th century. Mary is sometimes shown, in both Eastern and Western Christian art, being crowned by one or two angels, but this is considered a different subject.
** Visitation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       y4d45i80hkk0
:CUSTOM_ID: y4d45i80hkk0
:END:
In Christianity, the Visitation, also known as the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, refers to the visit of Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus, to Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist, in the Gospel of Luke, Luke 1:39–56. The episode is one of the standard scenes shown in cycles of the Life of the Virgin in art, and sometimes in larger cycles of the Life of Christ in art.
