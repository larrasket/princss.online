I had the first I met with Tony Marston <https://www.tonymarston.net> on the Internet was on Dec 2024, when I read his 2018 "Why I don't do Domain Driven Design", I found it a bit strange post, but in a good way (what I believed back then), I thought it's an enjoyable discussion, so I post it on Hacker News and it was discussed a bit [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42539477][there]]. I never met with Marston again, but I learnt that he had some radical, sometimes ridiculous, views. But how doesn't, right? Couple of days ago there was a discussion on GitHub about Object-Oriented Programming, I was not investing a lot of effort there pointing out my views, because it was obvious to me that the opponents are not distinguishing between "encourages", "allows", and "emphasize" bad practices[fn:8]. Someone replied to my comment there, I didn't pay a lot of attention once they mentioned that inheritance and encapsulation magnified their productivity. "you lost me after "inheritance". It sounds like you have no idea of how bad code looks like" [[https://github.com/gentlee/gentlee.github.io/discussions/4#discussioncomment-15183074][I wrote]]. I got a very strange response from their side, projecting, and just bizarre. "If my code is THAT bad, then why has it won numerous awards? If you think YOUR code is better than mine then take this challenge to prove it."[fn:9], the bottom line was "Note that in all cases I was using a development framework that I had designed and built myself. How many frameworks have you written?". I was just speechless at this moment when I read the email. I couldn't response, when I browsed some of the website, I realized this was Tony from the DDD article, but the rest of the website and content was not pretty at all, it felt like I went into a limited intelligence 70 years old elder who was a lot into programming. I've shown the commend to some of my friends who couldn't take it seriously at all, especially the "how many frameworks", one [[https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/1pgl5n3/note_that_in_all_cases_i_was_using_a_development/][posted]] it on r/programmingcirclejerk. The people there had more tolerance than me to look at Marston's world, and some made deeper investigations: "Let me explain something. There's a guy who writes code. He claims he can create in PHP in 5 minutes what would take 5 days to create using COBOL. He creates a product. He gets a letter saying his product has been nominated. The organization that gives out the prizes has a Twitter account without any announcements and a simple website that clearly states that participation is free. But to get the award and beautiful photos - you have to pay. Oh, and you won't find a list of nominees or a list of who received their award on their website. This guy writes that his anon fans nominated him, but I wouldn't be surprised if this organization itself creates spam mailings. I think it's even a little sad. Stupidity and self-confidence are a terrible combination. This guy seems to be losing touch with reality. Sad...", I opened Marston's [[https://old.reddit.com/user/TonyMarston][reddit profile]], first glance was -100 karma, I know reddit its awful but really how bad you need to be to get to -100? I found that the guy is just ragebaiting[fn:10] the whole PHP community, getting [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/yx0cte/comment/iyp3zfz/][roasted]] over and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/111f0r4/i_hate_deprecation_of_passing_null_to_nonnullable/][over]] and [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/z5ap2a/an_overview_of_the_architecture_on_which_the/][over]]. Some dude wrote on a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/yx0cte/how_to_create_a_family_of_forms_to_maintain_the/iwmmoe0/][comment]] "You just HAVE to look up this guy's website and previous discussions both here and on Sitepoint. You'll be entertained for hours.", although of all this continuous criticism and even bullying of the guy, he is so [[https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/core-developers-are-idiots.html][rude]] and [[https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/please-do-not-break-our-language.html][arrogant]], let alone stupid. I just feel sad for this, what it takes for someone to be like this? "When I read this, I imagined how David Lynch (RIP) would film it: a developer tries to start working but IDE is not installed on his computer. The developer takes a desperate step and tries to download and install IDE himself, but it turns out that IDE is already installed, it's just that its shortcut is not on the desktop. As if everything is not so bad, but the next moment he launches Vi... Panic, the clock on the wall starts ticking loudly. The developer calls his colleagues and asks for help but hears loud laughter in response..." ‒ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/1pgl5n3/comment/nsuh46b/][BenchEmbarrassed7316]].

Your opinion about natialism is not really valid when you're old, although it is
the only time you can tell whether it was a good idea or not. If you are a 50

no longer reproduce, you no longer have the power imbalance.

I had a discussion with the MPV developers regarding the software state on
MacOS (it was held on IRC), typically I was against MPV enabling "gaming mode"
to perform better, it's a very unarthodox action that no player else does, and
very annoying because, obviously, it is not a game, moreover it costs a lot of
unnecessary allocation and energy. Today I noticed how horrible the
auto-resizing feature is when you are having multiple monitors set together.
Consdiering moving my configuration totally out of it.

I've done some digital privacy violation acts throughout different periods, that
I'm not very proud of. Some of them involved some people with whom I shared
personal trust. Last year in 22 Jul, I discussed them with a close friend and we
made a journal for all of them. I realized then how most of these incidents
(almost all of them, the exception goes for a single one) I was not the one to
behold liable of the violation, rather, it's usually another entity that he or
she had shared the information with (usually inadvertently) which I dealt with
(for example botnet-as-a-service providers and RAT markets). Obv, وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي,
I am guilty for doing it in the first place, but what I'm pointing out here is
that most people who are getting digitally violated (that, basically, most of
tech illiterates out there) chosen not to care much about being violated by
someone at the first place, it only mattered to them when that shared
information was delivered to someone relevant, i.e. to me.

في قصة حي بن يقظان، يكلم حي رفيقه ابن سينا عن أشخاص حضروا مع الأخير ويحذرهم منه،
يتضح في التفسير اللاحق أنه ما كان يتحدث إلا عن حواس ابن سينا بشكلٍ رمزي. أثناء
قرائتي القصة مرة أخرى منذ أيام لاحظت هذا الوصف الجميل للحدس والتحذير منه: وأنك
لمبتلى بانتقاد حق ذلك [صالح: أي حق ما تحدثه به نفسك وهواك] من زوره، واستخلاص
صوابه من غواشي خطئة، إذا لا بد لك منه [صالح: يقصد أنه يستحيل أن تعيش دونه أو

Following is a good note on anger, mentioned in
[cite:@al-muqaffaa-2019-al-durrah-yateem]: اعلم أن من الناس ناسًا كثيرًا يبلغ من
أحدهم الغضبُ — إذا غضب — أن يحمله ذلك على الكلوح والتقطيب في وجه غير من أغضبه،
وسوء اللفظ لمن لا ذنب له، والعقوبة لمن لم يكن يهم بعقوبته، وسوء المعاقبة باليد
واللسان لمن لم يكن يريد به إلا دون ذلك، ثم يبلغ به الرضى — إذا رضي — أن يتبرَّع
بالأمر ذي الخطر لمن ليس بمنزلة ذلك عنده، ويعطي من لم يكن أعطاه، ويكرم من لا حق
له ولا مودَّة. فاحذرْ هذا الباب كلَّه، فإنه ليس أحدٌ أسوأَ حالًا من أهل القدرة الذين
يُفرِّطون باقتدارهم في غضبهم وسرعة رضاهم، فإنه لو وصف بهذه الصفة من يلتبس بعقله أو
يتخبَّطه المسُّ أن يُعاقِب في غضبه غيرَ من أغضبه، ويحبو عند رضاه غيرَ من أرضاه، لكان
جائزًا في صفته.

I had a terrible experience trying to self-host Supabase today. I have read on
the community posts that the experience is usually not very pleasant, however, I
found official maintainers responding to that saying that it was improved, with
a video showing it running on a 2GB of RAM and 2vCPUs droplet. I had various
problems with getting the docker-compose to work; apparently you can not really
change the default passwords without running into an authentication issue (see
[[https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/11957][here]] for example), and even if you fixed that you will go through couple of
[[https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/2737][analytics]] issues. My biggest concern, however, was that I was never able to get
anything to run on the very small droplet that the maintainer showed off, in
fact, the only specifications that could provide the bare minimum performance
(that is: the dashboard is loading) was 8GB of RAM, and two dedicated CPUs (yes,
dedicated, not vCPUs), however, even with that a lot of problems persisted (many
features are not working, and it is a hell to try to authenticate the CLI with
that setup). I wonder if their development team is choosing deliberately not to
make the self-host experience better to enforce people to use their cloud
services instead of selfhosting it. I really do not get the point of having such
a software to be open-source if it won't be easy to self-host.

* (outdated) How does this page work
- [2025-11-29 Sat 00:40] \\
  As of now this is very outdated, this blog runs from a highly sophisticated (yes I'm calling it that) Elisp system.
[2022-09-23 Fri 20:15]: If you are an old reader (if such a thing exists) of this blog, you should know by now about my many old attempts of creating a stack-based posting that works within my editing environment (Emacs) which has always failed. I'm very good at Elisp, suck at writing Elisp packages \*Sigh\* life doesn't give you everything. Anyway I thought that everything I need to implement such a workflow, is only a program that appends an entity top of a string, and I started to implement it as a separated program in Go. However, while doing it I recognized that ~(org-caputre)~ already does it, just needed a simple custom configuration:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq +org-capture-journal-file "~/blog/content/stack.org")
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("j" "Journal" entry
           (file+headline +org-capture-journal-file "Posts")
           "* %<%A, %d %B %Y>\n%?"  :prepend t)))
#+end_src

I also found a predefined way of doing it that build a full hierarchy date for
the entity, but I decided to go simple this time.

*Cons;*

+ I've to archive it myself, no pagination.
+ [2022-10-05 Wed 20:18]: I figured out a workaround to archive, and I don't
  think I really need tags. Everything works great.
+ [2024-02-15 Thu 20:19]: I do not find this workflow very good as of now, I do
  not think that archiving is necessary either. I wil try to think of something
  else soon.
