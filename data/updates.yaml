  content: 'Noodled around in code and found a way to add arrows to my <a href="/calendar/" target="_top">calendar</a> to extend events past one date. Only viewable in 100% zoom though. Removed <a style="text-decoration: 1px dotted underline line-through;" href="https://princss.online/archive.html" target="_top">archive</a> because it slowed the fuck out of my page uploads, and also don''t really see a reason to have it still seeing as every archived page is bugged anyway. Moved <a href="/guestbook/" target="_top">guestbook</a> in its place on the navbar. Also, changed the styling in <a href="/habits/" target="_top">habits</a> to the habit table header, making it darker. Should create more visual distinction between the different months when they are added later.'

Tweaked the index calendar so that each date highlights when hovered -- just because I''m addicted to :hover css styling.'

Tweaked the <a href="/diary/" target="_top">diary</a> <i>again</i> because I wanted to make it more responsive to different resolutions/screen heights--added a script that made it so that when a diary entry is visible the links in the navbar are highlighted ''active'' on that particular entry.
