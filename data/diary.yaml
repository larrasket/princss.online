    <p>I have finally moved out of my house and into a (nice!) apartment.</p>
    <p>It took a while, and it was the most stressful thing I have ever tried to accomplish in my life, but we did it. I have been agonizing over this apartment for the past month now, and every step throughout the way, I was instilled with doubt -- can I do this? Am I allowed to do this? What if I don't end up doing this? Should I live with my parents forever? But now all of those thoughts have been put to bed, and I am currently sitting in the living room (that I pay money for) typing away on my computer on the Wi-Fi that I set up, on the desk that I built with my hands. Everything has paid off for me. I genuinely can't believe this is my life.</p>

    <p>The move-out process was probably the most headache-inducing thing I have ever had to go through. I was worried about so many things -- so many insecurities about how this even worked, whether or not I had all the stuff needed, whether I was prepared mentally to go through this -- so many things.</p>
    <p>The previous nights before the move-in, Bree and I had started packing up all of the things (clothes, trinkets, electronics, etc.) into boxes that my Dad had left for us over the week. If there is one thing that I truly <i>hated</i> about this whole process, it had to be packing things. You don't realize how many things you need, and how they don't fit neatly into half-meter x half-meter boxes until you start putting them in those boxes. We were scouring through cabinets and closets and trying to organize it all neatly to where when we eventually reached the apartment, we would be able to neatly unpack them and put organize them in an orderly fashion. Not excited to do this again when I move out in the future.</p>

    <p>There was little rest on Wall Street this weekend. There was plenty of anger, anxiety, frustration, and fear.</p>
    <p>Anger at President Trump for a brash and chaotic rollout of tariffs that erased trillions of dollars in value from the stock market in two days. Anxiety about the state of the private equity industry and other colossal funds with global investments. Frustration among Wall Street's elite at their sudden inability to influence the president and his advisers.</p>
    <p>And fear of what may come next.</p>

    <p>The coming weeks will most likely be the biggest turning points in my life. I am moving out (potentially) for the second time in my life, this time with Bree. Just to reminisce, when I first moved out to College Station, the stakes were a lot lower. Rent was $500 a month (what a steal in retrospect) -- and sure, it was about an hour and a half drive away from my family, but I could always depend on them to cover me if I didn't have the funds to. It was kind of like going to college, but without the college. Now, I'm doing it for real. I am signing a lease and living completely independent from my family. I have a job, I have way more responsibility, way more bills to pay -- this is the real deal.</p>

    <p>I've officially had my first runaway pet. Bean ran out when I was bringing the groceries in, and she hadn't been out of the house in a while, so I let her roam a bit. And then she never came back.</p>

    <p>Investors may be losing stomach for all the churn. Even after Mr. Trump suspended some tariffs and paused others, the S&P 500 declined 1.8 percent. That brought the week's decline to 3.6 percent. Sell-offs have wiped out virtually all the gains since Mr. Trump was elected in November. <i>-- New York Times</i></p>

    <p>Things are going pretty well for good ol' me. It's been a long time coming. Boss let me know that I got a raise to a exorbitant $17/hr. I'm looking at moving out within the next 6 months, which is going to be amazing because I'm moving it with Bree and a friend!</p>
