              <p>Pretty much a daily drink for me. I can't stop putting down the lemon-flavored drinks, man. Could probably go through 3-4 cans a day if I didn't know that sucralose wasn't all the good for you. Still can crush a 12-pack of these in a couple of days. God I love lemon-flavored stuff.</p>

              <p>The classic imo. This got me through those dreadful College Station days because they were always in stock at my local H-E-B. Can never seem to finish them though -- around 89% of the way through the bottle I call quits. Still a great drink though. Has that 'cane sugar sweetness' that some of the fountains ones just don't have.</p>

            <p>Strawberry lemonade is very much an all-time beverage for me. Strawberry and lemon? Are you kidding. Popeyes' is serviceable though, might be a little bit too sour for my liking -- I like my lemonade as sweet as can be without being too saccharine -- but it's still strawberry lemonade, so you can't really go wrong. Pairs well with their chicken too.</p>

            <p>Sort of an all-time classic soda. Nothing tastes like it, but -- and sorry Bree -- it does not even touch the Mt. Rushmore of sodas. I'm a fruit soda guy myself, so if it doesn't have a fruity taste it immediately falls into the Chris Paul tier or below in terms of soda rankings. Also, probably the worst tasting soda when it's flat.</p>

            <p>Really the only Starbucks drink worth putting into you body. The right amount of sweetness and milkiness; plus the coconut taste is nice and not overbearingly disgusting like I find in other coconut drinks (sorry).</p>

            <p>On par with <a href="all.html#propel-zero-berry">Propel Zero, Berry</a> -- but tastes like grape! I don't usually like grape drinks, but this was good as hell. I think maybe if something is clear and has no color and doesn't taste like water it tricks my brain into liking it more than I would actually.</p>

            <p>I would be addicted to these things if I was a millionaire. Something about drinking a fruity drink that has <i>zero sugar</i> just enhances how much I love to drink these. Anyways, this is pretty much what it says it tastes like--orange and mango. Good stuff.</p>

            <p>The broth is not as strong as maybe a sukiyaki broth, but it's still very good. Mixed with a little bit of soy sauce, this is a very good broth to pair with thin sliced pork and thin sliced beef. Been having a lot of fun with at-home hot pot, and this was a great addition to the list of broths to try.</p>

            <p>You can't really go wrong with an orange soda, because they all pretty much taste the same. Yeah, it tastes kind of like an orange. Yeah, it's pretty much Fanta. I would just buy a Fanta next time, but hey, this does the job as well as it can. At least the can is cute!</p>

            <p>Drank some of this while I was working today. Not bad. Don't think I'm a fan of 'sweet tea' in general because the sweetness is kind of weak compared to the all-time GOAT tea, Texas sweet tea. This was pretty refreshing though and got me through the day. The Gold Peak Sweet Tea with Lemonade is way better, but this meets code.</p>

            <p>This was <i>the</i> refresher in my middle school gym class after class was over. Everyone would crowd in the men's locker room, right by the coach's office, and hand over $2 to Coach 'B' for a choice of Berry, Grape, or Strawberry Kiwi. I would either choose Berry or Grape. This drink has a lot of nostalgic attachment; I remember when I had already "graduated" middle school, I asked my Dad to get me a case of Propel to have at home. Now I drink it almost every day -- it's become a cornerstone of my life. Berry is good.</p>

            <p>Can't say I like protein shakes very much. Drinking them feels like drinking sand a little bit, the powder washing over your tongue is not something that I really enjoy. However, I can say that this protein shake is much better than its contemporaries. A lot of shakes have a distinctive flavor about them that tastes like whey, this one not so much. It really does taste like cacao so I'll give them that. Still a protein shake though. Only going to have this again because I'm a protein deficient husk.</p>

            <p>Two of my favorite things, carbonation and lemon. Unlike sprite which has more carbonation than it has lemon flavor (I don’t even taste the lemon in sprite) Sparkling Ice Lemonade has the perfect ratio between the two. The bubbles don’t assault your tongue, it’s more of a light prickle. Really good lemonade flavor, wish it was a little more citrus-y, but it still tastes like lemonade. Bought this on a whim and downed the fucker in 2 minutes.</p>

            <p>A little bit too much ice, not enough strawberry açaí or lemon flavor. Still good though, very refreshing on a hot summer day like today. Again, a bit watered down for my taste, at least towards the end of drinking it. That's my least favorite part of drinking most smoothies: finishing it. Always feels like you're drinking its slushy, diluted remains. Even more so for this one.</p>

            <p>This is actually a mixer that my cousin bought to mix in with some vodka for my Mom, but they left so we never used it. Decided to try it and it's pretty good. I like Grapefruit flavored anything really, so this one was likable. It does taste a little watered down; the actual amount of that grapefruit essence leaves something to be desired. But the small bottle it comes in is just the perfect amount of fluid ounces (16.9)</p>

            <p>Really refreshing, especially on a hot day. I find that a lot of sweet tea, especially Texas Tea, is a bit too harsh in its sweetness. Also I automatically like anything that is lemon flavored, which makes this my favorite AriZona tea flavor out of all of them.</p>

            <p>Not really the biggest fan of whatever a macchiato with espresso is. I looked it up and it's like a very rich, dark-roast espresso mixed with a lot of whole milk; just not for me. Only thing that I kind of liked was the caramel at the bottom that I could slurp up with my straw. Other than that, no redeeming factors. It's palatable, but I would never have this again unless it was the only drink that wasn't illegal.</p>
