            <p>As good as a bitter-tasting coffee can get for me. Feels pussy but I am a guy who likes to have his coffee taste like sugar and milk and sweet. But this is pretty good.</p>

            <p>Not really the biggest fan of whatever a macchiato with espresso is. I looked it up and it's like a very rich, dark-roast espresso mixed with a lot of whole milk; just not for me. Only thing that I kind of liked was the caramel at the bottom that I could slurp up with my straw. Other than that, no redeeming factors. It's palatable, but I would never have this again unless it was the only drink that wasn't illegal.</p>
